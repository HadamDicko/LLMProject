Review: Replacement phone! Works great!
----------------------------------------
Review: Updated review: i reached out to the Hybrid IT and explained my to them. They were willing to do return, exchange, and even offered to reimburse me for the price of a batter replacement through Apple or Best Buy. I went with an exchange. They no longer had the purple iPhone 11 in stock but color wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker. I let them know when I was ready to start my exchange and they sent me a shipping label. Once they received the phone they overnighted me my new phone. I just received it today. If all goes well I will not add another update. Hopefully I won‚Äôt have to make another update.
I got this phone mid May. When I received it the phone looked as expected. When I went to clean the screen for a screen protector there was and still is this sticky residue that won‚Äôt complete clean off. I wasn‚Äôt that concerned about it because I use a screen protector at all times. The screen protector doesn‚Äôt lag flush on the right side of the screen I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs because of the sticky residue, still not a deal breaker for me because it doesn‚Äôt mess with the functionality of the phone. When I received the phone the battery life was at 94 percent. I got it on May 15th. As of today, June 6 it‚Äôs at 90 percent. There should be no reason the battery capacity has lost that much in less than a month. I will probably be returning it. I got renewed premium because I wanted a higher battery capacity. I got my XR used in 2022. Battery capacity was 96. In 2024 it is only at 88. This isn‚Äôt adding up to me.
----------------------------------------
Review: I‚Äôm so excited about getting a renewed premium phone. I bought one first from someone else and it was an awful experience. This seller has taken such good care of me that it softens the blow of dealing with the other company. I had bought a phone in ‚Äúexcellent ‚Äú condition and it was defective. Can I believe they expected me to wipe my info from the phone , send it back and wait on their generosity to send me another one. The other choice was buy another phone and wait 30 days on credit.
Thank goodness I found this seller.
The phone was just like brand new! It was packaged beyond expectations. Looked like it could have come straight from apple.
I don‚Äôt have to tell u about iPhone features. Just look at description and that‚Äôs what u get or better. The battery life is 100%. It arrived before I could turn around. I couldn‚Äôt take a pic cause I‚Äôm on the phone. Lol
I‚Äôm still waiting however on Amazon to acknowledge they received my trade in. That my friends is a whole other ball of wax.
I‚Äôm so happy with my phone that I just ordered another one for my son

Review: Awesome
----------------------------------------
Review: I received my phone with the cable but not the wall plug. The wall plug was clearly stated as being a provided accessory with the purchase of this phone. Customer service first told me I was wrong and that a wall plug was not included. He was wrong he figured out but then transferred me to another rep who said if I wanted the wall plug i would have to return the entire purchase, phone and cable, in order for them to send it back to me with the included wall plug!? What!?! So i‚Äôm supposed to go without a phone for however long this would take in order to receive the wall plug that was missing, which wasn‚Äôt my fault at all? I had read many reviews before making this purchase which were all positive!! Those reviews included one from a buyer who was also was missing his ‚Äúincluded‚Äù wall plug accessory. That buyer stated he had no issues, he contacted Amazon and was immediately sent the missing wall plug‚Ä¶ ü§î But not me. I‚Äôm told I have to send everything back before they‚Äôll send the wall plug which I technically already paid for as an included accessory with this purchase. As for the phone itself, jury is still out. I had a serious issue a short time after purchase where my phone froze and would not do anything not even power off. I had to spend two hours with apple support to get the phone shut down and unfrozen. Apple couldn‚Äôt explain why this happened but hopefully it was a weird glitch and doesn‚Äôt happen again. I am hoping because I do love the phone. Super disappointed in Amazon customer service on the wall plug which I still have not received.
----------------------------------------
Review: It‚Äôs good but doesn‚Äôt pick up signals a lot of the time. I switched carriers thinking that was the issue but it‚Äôs the phone. It‚Äôs fine for now. Good price.
----------------------------------------
Review: this phone was in perfect condition
----------------------------------------
Review: Expecting an 100% battery life phone because of ‚Äúpremium‚Äù renewed, but got a 95% battery life instead, still pretty good but ehh
----------------------------------------
Review: I gave it a 4 star because the charger didn‚Äôt work. Phone features are great. Haven‚Äôt taken any pictures yet, glad I purchased this phone. Will be contacting seller about the charger soon.
----------------------------------------
Review: I used to have android phones but now want to try iPhones. This phone is great and easy to use. So glad I switched to iphone.11. I love this phone now. I thought it would be hard but no it‚Äôs not. I will always use this iPhone.
----------------------------------------
Review: Amazing! Great phone üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
----------------------------------------
Review: I was so skeptical about buying a used phone from Amazon but I cannot believe how well it worked out! I fully expected this phone to not work after the 30 day return window closed but it‚Äôs been working great. The phone is in perfect condition, I really liked how the phone included a charging cable and cube, as you don‚Äôt even receive those when buying from Apple!
----------------------------------------
Review: For my second try at buying an Amazon refurbished iPhone, I paid a little more for a certified reconditioning. This was an excellent idea, since it avoided the hassles in returning a faulty unit.
----------------------------------------
Review: After finding out that it is not fully unlocked like it was suppose to be my daughter decided to keep it and pick a new provider. Since she had been waiting a month with no phone due to the first phone being locked to a person still. The phone itself has no problems working just getting it set up was stressful.
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered this phone to have as my main phone with the old one as a backup. I am thrilled with the new phone. The color is exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly. I was able to set it up myself and transfer all the data from my old one without any issues. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the delivery and the phone itself. Thanks, Amazon!!
----------------------------------------
Review: like new condition‚Ä¶no scratches or marks‚Ä¶.battery was 100%‚Ä¶cant be any more happy after 3 months of extensive use‚Ä¶.if you want to use your old headphones with a 3.5mm jack, you have to purchase a 3.5mm to lightning adapter‚Ä¶.
----------------------------------------
Review: El cable cargador es de mala calidad pero por ahora fucniona.
----------------------------------------
Review: My 12-year-old daughter is satisfied, so I am happy. Delivery was on time.
----------------------------------------
Review: Beautiful phone!!! This is the only mobile phone that I have ever fallen in love with. Easy to hold on to. Beautiful color. Works great. Hold charge very well. T~Mobile was wonderful with the set up.
----------------------------------------
Review: It‚Äôs been a month with the phone, so far so good.üëçüëçüëç
----------------------------------------
Review: Perfecto
----------------------------------------
Review: It is working well so far. The battery life last pretty long like brand new. The volume level is not bad at all. I also love the color mint green. Overall it is a great phone. If you are looking for a new phone but do not want to spend a whole lot money I would recommend this phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: I am truly annoyed that I paid extra for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version of used phones and my box came missing the wall plug that was guaranteed in the description.
Amazon unwilling to help unless I return everything and purchase it again - which I won‚Äôt do.
Phone quality is great tho - 100% battery life. Dealing with Amazon has been the main issue.
----------------------------------------
Review: My daughter shattered her phone and I needed an affordable replacement. I‚Äôm very glad I found this seller. The phone arrived and looks and works like a brand new phone! The battery seems to last the entire day for her and the screen had no knicks, cracks, or scratches! Would definitely recommend and will buy again when the need arises (hopefully not soon haha).
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone came in pristine condition. Battery health was 92%. My only issue is that the haptic engine inside is so loose that it sounds like hair clippers every time it goes off for anything. Putting the phone on vibrate is like saying my ringtone is now loud hair clippers. Rather than send the phone back and go through the hassle, I‚Äôve opted to take it to an authorized Apple repair facility to have the haptic engine tightened down. If you‚Äôre going to pay the extra money for premium, you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about anything being wrong. You should essentially be getting a like-new device.
----------------------------------------
Review: Great deal. Was pretty much brand new
----------------------------------------
Review: I have bought many "renewed" iphones from Amazon. Almost all have been great! I believe they just started selling "renewed premium" with a battery life of at least 90%. This one came with 98%! It looks brand new and is working great so far. I would recommend buying the premium over regular renewed. The regular renewed only guarantees 80% battery life which is not acceptable to me.
----------------------------------------
Review: Like new. No issues. Quick shipping.
----------------------------------------
Review: Skeptical on purchasing refurbished items especially electronics, but this purchase was well worth it. The phone itself came out the Amazon renewed boxed almost like I got it from the Apple Store myself. The delivery was really fast arriving the next day after purchasing . Phone is in mint condition with handed signed certification of authenticity with all the components that was worked on. I am highly pleased with this purchase and will be ordering another one real soon.
----------------------------------------
Review: Couldn‚Äôt be happier with my iPhone 11 purchase. Couldn‚Äôt find a mark on it, front or rear. It came with a charging cable in a very nice Amazon refurbished box..The battery was at 100% and have been replaced with a genuine apple part. I was able to transfer my old phone into this new one including my existing carrier. I am writing this as one of the first times I‚Äôve reviewed because I almost didn‚Äôt purchase due to some of the negative reviews
----------------------------------------
Review: Ordered the phone for my son for Christmas (in 3 days). Got it and opened it only to realize there was no charging block. It had the cable and 2 pins to open the sim tray. I just thought that was what it was until i came back to read the description which says the charging block is included. Spoke to a rep who said the can‚Äôt send parts and i could return it for a refund. I will not return it especially with Christmas 3 days away. Just wished missing parts could be sent out. Phone is otherwise perfect so i guess i will be ordering and paying for a charging block.
----------------------------------------
Review: It was a gift for my friend who has been using the old iPhone 6. He really appreciate the present! Phone works fine with a good battery life.
----------------------------------------
Review: I received the phone within a few days. I did have to sign for it when it was delivered, which was fine. It was securely boxed and came with an off brand charger which I haven't even opened yet, as I have chargers from my other iphones around the house. This phone looks brand new, no scratches, no irregularities. It started right up, the battery is at 100% and I easily transferred all of my data to the phone from the cloud where my last phone backup was. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
----------------------------------------
Review: I had got the phone for the storage since my last phone only had 64 gb. So I paid for extra to have 256 only to eventually find out that the device only had 128 gb??? Not only that but the face id does not even work!
----------------------------------------
Review: Just as I hoped it would be. It‚Äôs in perfect condition and works just as it should.
----------------------------------------
Review: I will never again buy a new phone at the Apple Store. Not only did I get to avoid going to the Apple Store (hallelujah!) but I spent a considerable amount less. Still got the warranty and the phone perfect. I couldn‚Äôt be happier.
----------------------------------------
Review: Everything transferred except it got stuck on downloading ISO18 update. I tried it several times. A very techie friend could not get it down load
I ordered another one. Hopefully this one will work properly.
----------------------------------------
Review: My husband needed a personal phone and didn't want to spend a lot so he chose this one and so far so good! Thanks You!
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone came within 4 days as predicted with no damage so I was pretty happy about that but after taking it home and setting it up, I noticed that it was about to die and needed to be charged. BUT IT WOULDN‚ÄôT CHARGE. I tried a million different things and that didn‚Äôt work so I had to get a wireless charger just to charge it. Really disappointed considering I spent over $300. They could have at least checked that.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone looks and works like new. Battery was at 100 maximum capacity. Case and screen seemed perfect. Seems to hold charge really well and can go more than a day on a charge. Seller did not include a charging block with the phone as per item description but after contacting seller one was quickly sent. Seller was responsive and very easy to contact and work with.
----------------------------------------
Review: This iphone 11 is awesome! Looks like new, no scratches, chips or any cosmetic damage that I could see. The battery life started with 100% and was at 71% after 6 hours of being at work and using it sporadically throughout my shift. So i would say great battery life so far. I purchased it for $370 total and it was refurbished in excellent condition. Storage was at 128 G (i believe or closest to that number). So great value for this attractive looking phone that works wonderful- so far so good, aaaaaaay!!!! üî•üî•üôèüôèüôè
----------------------------------------
Review: I don't often review products, but this phone deserves some props. I was wary of "Renewed" phones, particularly concerned about how much battery life I would get. I've had the phone now about 10 weeks, and I couldn't be happier. Phone arrived in its custom-made box with a quick-start guide, protective film on both sides, and it looked brand new. Charged it up, and it has functioned perfectly. I waited 2 months to review because the phone was calibrating the battery health, which evidently takes weeks of self-monitoring. Yesterday it completed the calibration: The battery is 98% of new. If you don't want to pay for a brand-new phone, this is a great alternative.
----------------------------------------
Review: I received my IPhone 11 in good condition, 128GB enough for my editing purposes, other than forgetting my password and having to call apple support for so much hassle, it‚Äôs a fool proof phone since well, it‚Äôs locked to many third party, but other then that it‚Äôs a solid phone
----------------------------------------
Review: Everything is fresh
----------------------------------------
Review: had an iphone 14 stolen when traveling. Needed something i could grab quick and use, ordered this with 2 day shipping. Arrived in great condition, took it to the verizon store and asked them to transfer my number onto a sim card and activate on this phone, took about 10 minutes, good to go.
----------------------------------------
Review: From the reviews I read before making the purchase, I expected quality but was excited to find out that this phone happened to come with 100% battery capacity. Everything works just as if I had bought it from our service provider. This is the way to go for phones from now on.
----------------------------------------
Review: Iphones a great, don't get me wrong but don't buy refurbished ones. I was looking for a cheaper result than buying an iPhone and I found this one. It worked perfectly fine for maybe 2 weeks when my screen would glitch out and turn some pixels purple. It eventually stopped then at random I got logged out of all my apps and all the apps would become unresponsive and I had to figure out how to reboot the phone because the regular reboot (up to volume & power button) wouldn't work; though I could turn it on and off, and scroll on my home screen. Not too long after that, I couldn't update it till I had the reboot cycle going and had to update it through iTunes on my laptop. I can't say it was the worst phone/iPhone I have ever had, but it's getting up there. the constant closing of apps and data issues at random have been getting on my nerves. anyway, if you buy this phone just be warned about buying refurbished iPhones. maybe just trade it in after a while at the apple store.
----------------------------------------
Review: No problem with the phone. Works great. Absolutely love it.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone is fine minus the fact that the language setting won‚Äôt change even after updating the settings. The charger stopped working after a few weeks! Disappointing and too expensive for what you get.
----------------------------------------
Review: Received 2 days ago and can‚Äôt believe how impressed I am with performance and condition. Battery charging at 100% ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ not one scratch or mark anywhere on phone. Tried video, audio.. picture quality very good. Camera working nicely‚Ä¶ would recommend a try at this price for sure.
----------------------------------------
Review: No issues with this device. It is in excellent condition. I hope to use it for many years.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone is in excellent condition and 100% battery life so I am happy with the product. My one complaint is this makes the second order this month where I opted to pay a fee to get the product by a certain date only for it to not arrive on that date. It came on the free shipping date. I will no longer pick to pay to get it sooner because it‚Äôs apparently B.S. these days.
----------------------------------------
Review: I purchased a Renewed Premium device advertized to have at least 90% battery capacity. Upon receiving and setting it up, I discovered it only has 88%. When I contacted Amazon for resolution and asked about all of my options, I was told a refund is the only option because they're out of stock. Still needing a device, I asked why I was able to add another to my cart (same seller) if they're out of stock.
Khen said "I understand. The thing is that I see here in my end that this item is out of stock and to be honest, if you are able to add it in your card, there is a possibility that you will received a same iPhone with same issue." Why are they operating a business that sends out products that are contrary to what they're advertising?

Then he offered "If you would like a replacement. I. can transfer you to our team that can help you with the replacement." A replacement was the first thing I inquired about as a resolution.

Then he offered to transfer me to a replacement team and asked that I remain connected. Next he said the replacement team would be in contact in 24-48 hours and to please stay connected. Several minutes later I received a dialog that said the chat had paused and to engage & another rep would be with me shortly. I engaged and Khen said "I already notified the replacement department, they'll contact you in 24-48 hours." When I asked why I was instructed to remain connected then, he closed the chat window and I lost all dialog record.

I am quite concerned about Amazon Renewed's operating procedures. How many other consumers are receiving fraudulent product and inappropriate conduct from reps?
----------------------------------------
Review: Love my new phone. I have had it a week now. Works perfect and looks brand new. My old iPhone 7 was just a royal pain. Just obsolete I guess. This iPhone 11 is perfect! Good price too!
----------------------------------------
Review: Defective Charger, battery dies quickly. Voice quality is another issue, but not sure if the the problem is that version of the iPhone.
----------------------------------------
Review: Revised rating:
Finally Received product. Battery Health at 83%. I thought Amazon Renewed Premium products were supposed to be at least 90% battery health. Phone was clean with no scratches but I may have to replace the battery.

Original review: The one star is for Amazon, not the seller. I've yet to receive package thanks to Amazon. Amazon decided there was "no safe place for delivery" although we were home and I have received no updates since 6:21 am yesterday morning. I have messaged Amazon multiple times and all I get is the run around saying they have no updates. How can there be no updates when Amazon is doing the delivery? Terrible Amazon customer service.
----------------------------------------
Review: It‚Äôs not good phone they repair no nice I need refund plz thanks I mostly order from Amazon never happened this is first time I don‚Äôt wanna return because I put my I cloud and set up everything I need refund thanks if you nice I‚Äôll order again thanks for understanding
----------------------------------------
Review: I was weary of ordering a used iPhone but so glad I did. Phone was in immaculate/like new condition. After a few weeks I was able to check the battery health and it is 100%. Also felt good about the 1 year warranty. I searched the serial number of the phone and it was manufactured 11 months before I bought it so less than a year old. I would say Amazon Premium Refurbished is a good value over buying from other used-phone retailers.
----------------------------------------
Review: I‚Äôve had this phone for a couple of weeks now and can say I am very happy with it! Both my kids have iPhone 11‚Äôs and I paid double the price for one of them and triple the price for the other. I couldn‚Äôt even tell it was a refurbished phone. It charges to 100%. This purchase was so worth it! It takes great pics as well!
----------------------------------------
Review: It was a gift for someone so I haven't used the phone myself but, it seemed okay. Good price, good product.
----------------------------------------
Review: So after my then phone iPhone 6 S/Plus began acting up doing all sort of strange thing on its own I began my hunt for a new iPhone and settled on this... Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Unlocked (Renewed Premium). I was a little sceptical at first about buying a used phone but the new ones were a bit too expensive for me. So I decided to take the chance especially seeing the "Premium" added to the description. Turned out to be a good choice. I received the phone and did a restore from my backup which went seamlessly and painlessly...and also extremely fast. In no time at all I was back up and running with everything intact.

To begin with there were no scratches on the phone...condition perfect. And when I checked battery health I got a reading of 100%. So as said it was like buying a brand new phone. No regrets whatsoever.
----------------------------------------
Review: The seller experience for this refurbished iPhone was perfectly fine and went as promised. However, upon transferring information from my old phone to this purchase there was a prompt that a software update was necessary to proceed. However, once initiated the phone corrupted and would not recognize the SIM card that my cell service provider installed for me. After troubleshooting for a while, we were informed that this a known glitch and could not be scrub once the software update had been downloaded. I returned it.

Let me reiterate that this was not Amazon‚Äôs or the seller‚Äôs doing. The return went smoothly as well. On the other hand, I hope this review alerts them to this issue with the iPhone 11. Avoid updating the software if possible or go with a more current model
----------------------------------------
Review: Replaced my mediocre IPhone 8 and I gotta say, it‚Äôs a good upgrade.
----------------------------------------
Review: El telf ten√≠a el 100% de bater√≠a, es incre√≠ble, dura 2 d√≠as la bater√≠a. Estoy feliz, volver√© a comprar en esta tienda.
----------------------------------------
Review: It is like new, perfect!
----------------------------------------
Review: Came in generic box that included a charging cable and SIM card remover. Looks brand new. Works perfectly. I will definitely use the renewed program in the future. Great deal on a like new iPhone 11.
----------------------------------------
Review: It works great
----------------------------------------
Review: Great phone for the price but just know that it is used. And even tho they say they replace the battery, but the phone will still freeze. Its like replacing an engine in a car. You have a new engine, but everything else still needs to be replaced. Just keep that in mind when buying the phone. Also very little product support except they will take the phone back.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this for my mom, I live in Venezuela so it took a month from ordering for it to arrive home and I was beyond nervous. I tested the phone by myself (turned it on, tried the touchscreen, put in a local sim card, and made a call). It all worked! I am glad! also, the phone is in PRISTINE condition, not even a scratch!!!! I know my mom will love it, I have an iPhone 11 myself and even in 2022 it's working so smooth! even the camera quality is stunning despite the 13 having some upgrades. The only downside: A local store had the 128 GB version for the same price I paid for this one (without international shipping) but that's honestly on me, lol.
----------------------------------------
Review: Update: Returned the first one and the replacement works well! Would buy again.

At first the phone was good, and then a short while after setting it up it logged me out of all of my apps. That was annoying but got back in and it was fine. Then the phone and apps started crashing multiple times per day even after I‚Äôd restart it. Today none of my apps, including messages, will open up and phone will not shut off to restart. Returning it and getting a replacement. Fortunately there‚Äôs a year warranty on it. I‚Äôll update review if new one is better.
----------------------------------------
Review: Purchased this phone for my daughter for Christmas. Of course it arrives in a box stating Amazon renewed, but it looked as if it were brand new. Highly recommended.
----------------------------------------
Review: Excellent condition, works well. Like brand new.
----------------------------------------
Review: Battery is in perfect health & I appreciated that it came with a sim removal tool & charger.

Only complaint is that the clear sticker they put on the back left a sticky film that was hard to scrub off.
----------------------------------------
Review: I was pleasantly surprised at the condition of this refurbished phone. It looks brand new- no scratches. I have had it for over a week now and the battery is holding up just fine and the phone has had no issues. Would recommend this phone from this seller and will be using them again when the need arises.
----------------------------------------
Review: 
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this for my son and had thought about buying a slightly less expensive version. Glad I went with this one because it‚Äôs been great so far (couple of weeks now). Battery health is a big concern when buying a used phone and there can be deals out there but you‚Äôre willing to gamble on that risk. But when purchasing a guaranteed reconditioned phone then there is way less of a risk cause it‚Äôs supposedly easy to return.
Fortunately don‚Äôt really know cause the phone I bought was at 100% battery health and has had no issues. So yeah, I‚Äôd recommend this purchase.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone worked and looked good. Be advised if your switching sim from old iphone(8) to an 11, sim card is installed upside down or gold side facing up.
----------------------------------------
Review: The screen adhered to the frame looks like it‚Äôs full of residue from the glue or some adhesive. It looks so nasty. The screen itself looks like a cheap replacement. The speaker by the notch looks really dirty and off. Will be returned‚Ä¶
----------------------------------------
Review: it looked completely brand new and it was what i wanted.
----------------------------------------
Review: This I Phone is something I am still learning. The cam panorama is incredible. You can start recording the left side of your area all the way to the right side and it will make one photo of the entire space. I don't use face recognition so I gave it a 3 star. The battery life is ok. The value for the money? Not really. $430 is steep. I hope I learn more about this IPhone so I can see why it is different from the Samsung phones. Another thing about the IPhone 11 pro? There is no plug for earphones. You can only use bluetooth.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone came dead I‚Äôm still trying to transfer from my iPhone 8plus that I‚Äôve had for 4 years and Al. Now nothing it keeps dying in the middle of the transfer and to make matters worse I can‚Äôt send it back because I‚Äôm all the way in Jamaica üò©
----------------------------------------
Review: I absolutely love this phone!!! It came in excellent condition and it works perfectly! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase!
----------------------------------------
Review: I trust the Amazon guarantee for this refurbished phone. So far, it‚Äôs just like new.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this iPhone knowing full and well how absolutely picky I am about imperfections. I knew it was possible that I could get a phone that was perfect to some, but not to me. To my surprise, this phone was exactly as advertised. LIKE NEW!

My battery health was 92%, and there wasn't a single scratch on the device. I made sure to get the amazon renewed premium because their warranty is everything! I think if you start looking at these devices you will not be disappointed. I liked mine so much that when my son's phone got ran over by a forklift, I was able to get him an iphone in the same program for an unbeatable price.

Buy an amazon renewed phone. You won't be disappointed.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was in good condition and was packaged well; however, the battery health was a little low.
----------------------------------------
Review: Compre este tel√©fono bajo la condici√≥n premium y me encant√≥ la condici√≥n en la que llego el dispositivo. Pr√°cticamente nuevo el celular, sin rasgu√±os y todo funciona como debe.
----------------------------------------
Review: Received a perfect condition, 100% battery health phone. Hope you all get as lucky.
----------------------------------------
Review: Very nice that this phone was fully charged & I was able to use it after I took it out of the box. This refurbished phone works great & looks brand new! Would highly recommend also a great price
----------------------------------------
Review: Works great
