# LLM Sentiment Analysis Project

## Hadam Dicko 

## Overview
This project utilizes the phi3-mini model to perform sentiment analysis on predefined prompts. The script reads user prompts from a file (`prompts.txt`), sends these prompts to the model, and writes the responses to an output file (`results.txt`).

## Features
- **Prompt Handling**: Reads multiple questions from `prompts.txt`.
- **Model Interaction**: Utilizes the specified Hugging Face model (`microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`) for generating responses.
- **Output Management**: Saves the generated responses to `results.txt`, organizing them alongside their corresponding prompts.
