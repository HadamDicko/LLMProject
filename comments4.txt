Review: A few things, I ordered a white iphone 12 in excellent renewed condition. The first phone I received was less than desirable. Some wear i expected from a used device but not nearly the condition of what I got. I contacted the seller (MobileSupply), expressed my concern and they offered to make it right. I was given the choice of a total refund, exchange the device for another, or keep what I had received and they would apply a discount. Since I ordered this phone for my mom and she needed one, I chose to exchange for another device. As soon as the seller received the initial device back, they overnighted me a new phone. And this new phone was in near perfect condition. A screen protector was already applied too! The speakers and charging port where pristine as well. And to top it off, the battery capacity was at 95%! This was one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon. I couldnt even pick out any minor scratches. Again, maybe a gamble but I'm happy with my purchase. Thank you.
----------------------------------------
Review: I took very seriously my approach to buying an iPhone i researched all the different refurbished models on Amazon and I went online to various search engines looking for other reviews on potential iPhones.

I even weighed the benefits of buying used versus new. I made my choice with this iPhone 12 and even paid an extra $10 to have it delivered sooner. When it got here I was very impressed as it had 100% battery life left. The transfer from my old iPhone took a while due to the fact it first had to be updated to the latest iOS version. After the update everything else was simple.

But here's the problem. The Wi-Fi icon grayed out after 2 days leaving the phone unable to connect to the internet. I did hours of research looking at 10 different fixes and tried them all three or four different times. None of them worked and most reviewers who addressed this problem said if the fixes don't work it is probably a hardware problem with probably the internal antenna and that needed to be fixed by an authorized iPhone repair shop or someone else who knows what they're doing.

That wasn't going to happen so I unfortunately had to send the phone back.
----------------------------------------
Review: This was my second time ordering this. First time was great. This time I received the iPhone it was in Chinese upon starting. The seller Macs Depot was very responsive, let me send it back and refunded me for the purchase within a day of them receiving it back. Very fast communication, and refunded quickly. Thank you for being upfront, and valuing customers!

Review: Excellent Refurbished iPhone 12 – Great Value!

I was a bit hesitant to buy a refurbished iPhone, but I’m so glad I did! The iPhone 12 I received is in fantastic condition. It arrived looking almost brand new, with just a couple of very minor scratches that you wouldn’t notice unless you’re looking closely. Battery health was at 100%, which is excellent for a refurbished phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone looks new. Seems to work fine but battery life doesn’t last. Maybe it’s a iPhone issue or because it’s refurbished. Idk but I’m new to iPhone my old phone was a Samsung and it lasted all day. This phone I have to charge multiple times a day.
----------------------------------------
Review: I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by purchasing a refurbished phone that I wouldn’t be 100% satisfied. This is the second refurbished phone. I purchased through Amazon. My last one I purchased was a pixel and I missed having an iPhone so I gifted that to my daughter to purchase another iPhone. Unfortunately the battery life is not the greatest. The pixel I could use for two days without charging. This iPhone, I end up having to charge after dinner time. And I don’t use it that much. Like I said you take your chances when getting a refurbished item. So I will be taking a rechargeable device with me when going on longer trips..
Otherwise it’s bigger then my SE I had before, which is nice but don’t like I have to OPEN my eyes to turn off my alarm, as every External button only puts your alarm on snooze
----------------------------------------
Review: Came FASTER (by like 4 days) than estimated, "good" condition was practically like new (a couple of really minor scratches on the side of the phone, nothing on screen or back, nothing big). Everything works perfectly, EXCEPT - the battery. According to the settings it still has 81% of it's original charge available, but it honestly seems less than that. Still, it stays charged a lot longer than the iPhone 11 and iPhone XS I was trading up from. End of the day, I'm happy.
----------------------------------------
Review: Came in a box that said “SmartDevice” so you can imagine the drop in my heart when I opened the box—luckily there was an actual iPhone, cord, block, and sim card tool in there. I’m currently setting it up now and everything seems to be going as expected for now. Phone came perfect other than small chip in the paint on one corner. Otherwise, perfect condition and if it lasts longer than a year I’ll consider it to be a good purchase
----------------------------------------
Review: Originally ordered this phone and everything was working fine. Started to notice when it would die and we would plug it in the charger it would automatically turn on almost like it had a defective battery. After about a week’s use the phone died and we plugged it in the charger and it would not turn back on. We contacted the seller and they were very receptive and quick in responding to our technical issue. The offered to send a replacement phone and I returned the original phone. The replacement was shipped over night. Would definitely order from them again. Great customer service!
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is great! The one thing that was missing was the correct charging cord. I had one so that was good, but I couldn’t use the one they sent.
----------------------------------------
Review: We’ve bought several reconditioned phones over a couple of years from ELECTRONIC DEALS and they’ve all been in excellent/perfect shape. I recently bought from PRIVI TECH LIMITED (also a seller here through Amazon) and the phone arrived dirty and cracked around the camera. I returned it immediately and Amazon refunded the money, but two months later the return status still says “awaiting your return”. Anyway, highly recommend ELECTRONIC DEALS — they’re a solid seller.
----------------------------------------
Review: I’ve had this phone for almost 3 months now and the day that I got it the speakers were acting so weird. When the battery gets low, the phone is almost whispering. But now I’m starting to have issues with the screen.The screen flashes, the LED screen (green blue stripes) , I have to click the power button and restart it for that to stop. Apple won’t fix it because they said it’s an aftermarket screen they put on. Contacted the seller about the speaker and they told me to send it back, but then I would be out of a phone for a while having to ship it through the mail(as a mother, I need to have a phone on me at all times)…. I paid the extra money to get the highest quality of refurbishment…. Also When I received the phone, I had noticed a couple of dents around the back, but I didn’t mind since I put OtterBox on it. But on the back, you can see the back screen was replaced before because it’s not closed all the way…. I’m assuming that means my phones not water resistant , But like I said, I just keep it heavy duty case on it… I had to save up for a while to get this phone, so I was kind of disappointing that it has a couple of issues. But unfortunately, with my situation, I just have to deal with it. I’m grateful that the phone can work When I need it, But I should’ve just got the basic refurbishment and not the excellent one…

Review: Starting w/ an iPhone 8, migration of data (contacts, photos & apps) was made easier when the two instruments could pair side-by-side. This is the first time in my experience w/ iPhones that a migration was very complete (read Pleased). Near the end of the migration, I am asked to upgrade the Apple OS ... which I took.
One small glitch: the SIMM card did not migrate due to physical / form factor changes between the iPhone 8 & iPhone 12. This is remediated by the carrier with a software / electronic SIMM "card".
Cheers,

----------------------------------------
Review: I received this phone and noticed how it looked like it had never been used even thought it's refurbished. I also checked the battery area and noticed there was a brand new battery placed in it. I love this phone and have had it for a few days now and it has absolutely no problems. Glad I got it.
----------------------------------------
Review: It appears to be working well. It is my daughter Jerusalem,s phone.
It was used and refurbished so had some small dings.
I explained possibly better idea that it was checked out and corrected to attempt to guarantee service and operation Yes my little 13 year old darling was jumping and bouncing.around Got her wish Apple Tablet and I phone Good I can help.her to be what she deserves A Happy, Healthy, Smart. Pretty young lady. To love God because He loves her. To.know right and wrong.. To feel, live life and be grateful for the Beauty and Good in the World. BLESSED BE
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone is working great as per the description with good battery life. All functions are working properly and recommend to anyone who is looking for refurbished phones. Only issue is, we are not able to create new Apple ID with this device. We created separately and added to the device.
----------------------------------------
Review: I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years, she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.

Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet!

Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!
----------------------------------------
Review: I’m so happy that I purchased this refurbished iPhone 12 in the color red it came the next day before to 11am so right on time or let’s say surprised it came before it’s expected time. I placed my order the previous night by 7pm
Phone is working perfectly like its brand new
Will definitely recommend this seller to my friends if they need a iPhone immediately in case of an emergency a WIN PURCHASE
----------------------------------------
Review: the phone is good but the battery health is poor only 78%
----------------------------------------
Review: Received the phone the next day with prime one day shipping! Phone came with battery around 43%. Checked battery health and it showed 100% capacity. The iPhone 12 Amazon certified renewed was in great condition. Payed $335 for the phone so I did expect it to be in great condition so very pleased with this purchase. Thank you.
----------------------------------------
Review: phone works but I ordered blue and it came white
----------------------------------------
Review: 0nly 4 stars because no booklet on how to use it was included.
----------------------------------------
Review: 80 % battery with four scratches but nothing else
----------------------------------------
Review: The first phone I received had some scratches which is fine i spent over an hour transferring data, hooked up to my provider and made a video chat and realized the front camera is broken. Put in for a replacement, they would send another phone until they received the phone back which sucked because i needed a phone asap and they sent me the phone broken, over a week later i received the replacement, a few dings and scratches but the phone is in working order and battery was better then the 1st phone was 80% second phone was 91%.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone arrived in fairly good condition with one obvious flaw, as scratch near the frame/bezel. Battery health was exactly at 80%, so at the lowest end of the scale.
----------------------------------------
Review: It’s a pretty good phone. Works great my only issue is the top left corner of my screen is not secured into the phones housing and I did not receive a sim removal tool like stated in the description. I have not got ahold of the seller to have them replace the phone for the screen being messed up bc I am in need of a phone and just don’t have the ability to go without one for the time it would take to receive the replacement
----------------------------------------
Review: Got what I expected. I am satisfied with this product.
----------------------------------------
Review: Got this as a birthday present for my husband and he loves it! Obviously i got him the “excellent” one because he deserves nothing less, and I don’t know if that’s why it’s in such amazing condition or not but that’s what I’ll keep telling myself 😂 I don’t see scratches on it nor any dents only the charging port had some white spots around it (not sure if it shows in the photo) but that’s ok, if that’s the worst of it then I won’t complain! Came with a screen protector on it and with a charging block AND charger! Like wow! Will absolutely will buy from here again!
----------------------------------------
Review: 1 day delay on delivery which had me upset but other than the the phone came in perfect condition no scratches no nun. came with battery half way full and a charger with a tool to remove the sim tray. although in the settings it says that the camera is not a genuine apple part other than the the phone is perfect.
----------------------------------------
Review: Amazing seller. The phone is brand new. There is no scratches whatsoever. It even has a screen protector came with a charger and a plug. Battery life is 100%. It’s even still on the Apple warranty definitely recommend thank you so much 10 star seller.
----------------------------------------
Review: Really good for the price range
----------------------------------------
Review: I recently got the Apple iPhone 12 (Renewed)in Red. The phone was unlocked and came with a charger included and it’s a fantastic device. Performance was smooth, and display was good it’s an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone, but the price is bit High
----------------------------------------
Review: My review is that you should do your homework before purchasing. I needed a phone so bad and bought this one. The battery drains rapidly everyday. That was one of the reasons for replacing the phone. With that said, the phone was delivered so rapidly and even got a Saturday delivery into a rural location. Now that's service. The phone is clean and shiny. It does more than my old iPhone, its larger and doesn't fit my hand so well, but I'm getting used to it finally. I love that it has more features than my old iPhone. After much research, I learned this phones battery just drains rapidly. The reviews online are plenty. I changed a few settings and that helped a little.
----------------------------------------
Review: My old iPhone “died” on me and it would have cost me almost as much to repair it as to replace it. This phone works very well. I was able to get most of my stuff back from my iPhone backups. There wasn’t much in the way of instructions and I had a bit of a challenge because my old iPhone had a button at the bottom to select and turn off apps and turning on and off the new iPhone was a bit challenging to figure out but once I got that “swiping “ the screen stopped apps and holding the power button with the volume button brought up the turn off option I was fine. I think the screen is better than my old one and now I’m accustomed to it I like the new iPhone better.
----------------------------------------
Review: Purchased a refurbished iPhone 12 64gb that was quoted as "excellent" quality. The phone was in great shape with minor signs of wear. Really happy with the purchase, except with the battery being at 80% health. 4 out of 5 stars because of this.
----------------------------------------
Review: Refurbished iPhone 12 received in two days to replace lost iPhone 11. Received in excellent condition (...no face scratches) as advertised. Was able to add my old number to the phone (...using tips from Apple Tech Support); then erase all existing Apps & Data on the iPhone 12 (...except for the eSIM!) & then upload my Apps & Data from my old phone using iCloud Backup. Had to log in and re-establish 2FA with a few of the Apps, but no major issues with that, and was back in business!

Only annoying aspect was that the supplied charger cable stopped working after a day, but I had plenty others laying around.

Overall, a very gratifying experience, and now I have 5G access. Tip: If you utilize 2FA for some of your Apps; if they permit, set up the option of BOTH a phone number & an email...from laptop, in case you lose your phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: We’ve had this phone for a few days. It came charged and ready to use. It had a power cord. The screen and phone are in good shape. It has held a change and my daughter loves using it.
So far so good!
----------------------------------------
Review: I liked everything about it except the battery which was only at 86% i was hoping for 100% but its alright ill eventually replace it the screen had 2 small scratches overall great phone for the price i paid got the phone screen protector and a case for only $313
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is awesome and everything it’s worth it just understand you do have some technical issue . Mine is as slow as I am. We both show our age. Also, he gets tired as much as I do. His battery drains a lot faster, but after a good charge, he’s good to go for a couple hours so he needs to be charged. I have to charge them at least twice a day unlike a new phone you don’t have to do once a day if that. I don’t regret getting my phone. I love my phone the more I work with it the more I love them I would do this again because I do not want to pay the price of a brand new phone, especially when it’s bought two of them so it is worth it. Luv~n~Peace
----------------------------------------
Review: Came in decent quality and came in quicker than expected, but I should’ve gotten it in better quality for what I was spending. Works well, and looks good but theirs small white markings on the corners of the phone due to small damage.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this phone for my son and for the most part it works pretty good. It does tend to get hot really easy. That’s one thing he has complained about but other than that the battery last a long time the durability on it is great. It’s easy to use Great quality , The sound quality is exactly what we expected ,Charging great,it is most definitely worth spending the money on if needed to I would buy it again.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is in excellent condition , it seems to function perfectly the only thing I noticed so far is the battery life is only at 83 percent. Will that affect me going forward.
----------------------------------------
Review: In particular, the cell phone arrived completely well, I am satisfied with the purchase, the only thing to highlight is that the battery arrived at 86%, but taking into account that the cell phones are reconditioned it is good, very good option ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
----------------------------------------
Review: Product arrived as promised, in the condition, and with the accessories stated in the sales description Well done!
----------------------------------------
Review: Lo compré ase un semana y es lo que promete no eh tenido ni un solo dilema y esta como nuevo lo recomiendo
----------------------------------------
Review: The color is amazing it’s fully unlock and upgraded the battery came at 80% and there are no scratch or dents on it
----------------------------------------
Review: it's a solid phone with a good balance of performance and features, but it doesn't stand out as much as previous iPhones
----------------------------------------
Review: This might be the most traveled phone this year. Arrived quickly at the drop shipper location in Miami before being forwarded to me, an expat living in Ecuador.

Well after long delays at customs here in Ecuador it was returned to Miami. Refurbished phones are not allowed to be imported into Ecuador. Long story short after two trips around the US it was hand delivered yesterday by a helpful traveler.

The phone arrived (refurbished premium) in perfect physical shape, not a mark or scratch. It functions flawlessly. Why the 4 stars? I would gladly give 5 save for that premium phones are guaranteed to exceed 90% battery life, sadly this one is at 88% so a bit short. It’s been over two months since ordering so I’m gladly keeping this iPhone 12.
----------------------------------------
Review: La verdad me sorprendió no había tenido iphone antes y se ve cuidado.
Es reacondicionado excelente
Estética 9/10
En la pantalla tiene un detalle que sin protector no se notaba, me di cuenta cuando le puse el protector la verdad, es un poco molesta pero esta todo lo demás muy bien.
Vi la reseña de otros y se veían maltratado por fuera y el mio llego muy bien y sin rayones en la parte trasera ni en la cámara.
No llego el adaptador de corriente eso me molesto porque tuve que comprar uno.
Se ve mejor en persona si no tuviera protector puesto y resaltará el detalle de la pantalla pareciera nuevo. Lo recomiendo si estas buscando una opción más económica y por el momento funciona bien,espero y siga así
----------------------------------------
Review: I have been using the phone for around 10 days and it works perfectly fine. It did not have a single scratch. Battery life came with 92%, the only thing is that sometimes when I’m on a call with someone, signals cuts off but it happens when I’m outside my house. I’m still testing the phone to figure out if it’s a problem the phone has or it’s just me not having good signal but so far that’s the only thing I’m still testing so that’s the only why I gave it a 4 out of 5 but other than that I’m impressed and happy with the phone. I mostly think it’s just the place that have bad signal but I want to make sure. I’ll be back to write my final review .
----------------------------------------
Review: Delivered today and I am very happy so far, battery health is 87, phone is clean, no scratches it looks good as new everything works as it should and I was able to transfer my number over easily
----------------------------------------
Review: We were skeptical when ordering a refurbished phone but are happy we took the chance and did it. the phone arrived in perfect condition and my wife could'nt be happier. We saved some money and upgraded her phone. Definitely give it a shot if you're on the fence.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was ok but it came only with a cable. Where is the AC adapter outlet
----------------------------------------
Review: i chose excellent and i got a phone that looked brand new no scratches nothing but there was alot of build up dust in speakers and silent switch
----------------------------------------
Review: A month or so after we received the phone, we could no longer text or make calls from it. We took it to the Apple store for inspection and the 4G receiver was found to be inoperable. Of course it was going to cost as much to replace the phone as to fix it. The phone was not dropped or submerged in the time that we owned it. We returned it without issue and are going to give this seller another chance. This time we're springing for "Premium" renewed and if this phone stops working inexplicably, I'll be back to downgrade this review for sure.
----------------------------------------
Review: apart from some engraving mark and the battery which is 85% it's a superb purchase everything is normal, thanks
----------------------------------------
Review: Good service from Amazon. I ordered renewed premium iphone 12 64 GB. Phone came with 100% battery capacity although initially it was fully dead. I had to charge it to turn on power. There were no noticeable scratches in the phone. I received this phone one week ago around. Still good service. Don't know what will happen in the future.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone was great. Went to my carrier and had it all set up for no cost.
----------------------------------------
Review: 6 months later the refurb phone works well, no problems at all, good value for money
----------------------------------------
Review: This is just what I needed a perfect phone to use for work, I got it with 100% battery life. Which after buying many used products on Facebook, eBay, Amazon. I finally got one with 100% battery, guys this is once in a lifetime type of deals. I wouldn’t let this go by as I never really see this happen. I would grab this now run don’t walk to grab it.it comes with the screen protector, and a charger, and an ejector tool. I would recommend It comes with the screen protector, and a charger, and a Sim injector tool. I would recommend grabbing a case on Amazon as well for six bucks. And this is an honestly great phone. I would totally buy again.
----------------------------------------
Review: Very nice
----------------------------------------
Review: Great phone. One minor scratch I’ve seen but everything works perfect. It’s new to me!
----------------------------------------
Review: Receive my phone great shape no problems getting it online. Works excellent screen in good condition. Very satisfied.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone works but there is a message that camera is not genuine Which I wasn’t expecting.
----------------------------------------
Review: I’m cheap and I’m not interested in the newest and best technology for that reason. When the camera in my IPhone 10 stopped working and the battery would not hold, I upgraded to this iPhone 12 listed as “excellent” quality. The battery life is great, phone looked brand new, and I’ve had no issues. I agree with the “excellent” label and would highly recommend.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone was flawless besides one little chip that was barely noticeable. I did pay for renewed premium which was supposed to come with over 90% battery health. Phone came with 87% battery health. Everything worked as expected. Setup was smooth no issues with the display or anything. Will knock one star off for battery not being over 90% health.
----------------------------------------
Review: Like the lightness compared to my Samsung S24 Ultra. No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100%
Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good.
I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra.
In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.
Sorry my review is not more in depth.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone itself functions as its supposed to, but I feel like it could've been cleaned a little better before selling and there were a few small imperfections on the screen as well. Overall, it does what it needs to do and I am just glad to have a functioning phone
----------------------------------------
Review: iPhone is perfectly fine and unlocked, works great except for the first few hours/day there were neon green, pink, and black thin stripes running vertically on the screen showing signs of damage. Not too bothered bc there were very thin only on the right side, and went away after some pushing on the screen and resetting phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phones looks as new , no scratches or dents . It’s too clean
----------------------------------------
Review: The device showed serious signs of use but works just fine as it should, and for the price, I'm totally satisfied.
----------------------------------------
Review: I love this phone. When I first got the phone I was unsure whether I would enjoy an iPhone I have had the phone for months now and it work perfectly and I love the ease and convenience of its operating system
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered Apple iPhone 12 128 GB renewed, this is for the first time I bought renewed phone online and it is out of my expectation. As soon as I open the package the phone looks brand new. They added screen protection with lightning cable and usb adaptor. I suggest buying from HybridIT.
----------------------------------------
Review: Pros: The phone is great for what I need. The battery health was very good.

Cons: For an "Excellent" rated phone, there should be no scratches on the front glass. There was one on mine. Power and volume buttons also had scratches and wear on them as well. I don't know who the previous owner was, but it was as if they used a metal object on these buttons. Seller should know better than to grade a phone in this condition and sell it at a higher price. This indicates that they are not trustworthy and have lacking QAQC.
----------------------------------------
Review: The iPhone appeared in excellent condition as I unpacked it. I had no problem transferring everything from my old phone, BUT when I tried to use the camera to take a picture of a card, I discovered that the picture was not in focus. I tried several more times - each time was the same result. Then, when I went into the 'setting' to do some corrections, I discover a statement that said "The camera for this iPhone is not recognized. An Apple Authorized Service Provider can repair or replace the camera to restore full functionality.". Apparently, the 'remanufacturer' has installed a second-rate camera into this phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: Great little phone it's a beast for sure!! Good shipping and good product!!
----------------------------------------
Review: If you don’t mind the quality of ecofriendly electronics (renewed) this is a great option. Keep in mind that this means there might be a few scratches or even dent damage to the physical part of the phone. But it is fully operational and working properly. Great with Charging no problem with a battery health of 84%! Camera quality is great, loved it when filming videos, and it’s a good size for larger hands.
----------------------------------------
Review: I love the color it fits just perfect in my hands
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone came with a broken charger the phone works great
----------------------------------------
Review: Had it for a week and it’s working perfectly! Like new just like it said. Very happy customer!
----------------------------------------
Review: I received this iPhone with a noticeable scratch on the left side of the screen. Not happy with the quality control on this.
----------------------------------------
Review: My phone arrived in pristine condition. It was very easy to set up and transfer data from my old iPhone. So far I am very pleased with my purchase, however the one discrepancy is that it was guaranteed to have a batter health of at least 80%, but mine only has 79%. I’m upset that I’ll have to spend more money to get a better battery sooner than I expected, but the quality of the phone itself still made it a worthwhile purchase.
----------------------------------------
Review: We purchased the phone as a gift for the mother in law. The phone was received nicely boxed and free of any cosmetic defects, looks new.

However, I tried to put a screen protector (tempered glass) on the phone, and the defects were found. There are indentations in the screen. These indentations seem to have no affect on the operation (yet to be noticed) but prevent the glass from laying flat with no bubbles. The screen protectors came in a 3 pack so I tried 3 times, same locations. I know doing the same thing multiple time and expecting a different outcome kinda means I’m insane, but oh well.

There is not enough time to return and retry before her birthday so we are going to go with this one without a screen protector at risk.

So much for renewed “premium”.

Would I purchase again, probably but give us more time to swap it out, my bad for not checking earlier.
----------------------------------------
Review: my (black iphone 12, 128 gb, unrestricted cell carrier) delivered quickly and in good shape. no scratches, although i scratched mine pretty quickly(my screen protector i ordered separately took longer to deliver). my recommendation is to use this phone as little as possible until you get a screen protector on it.
overall happy with this product. hopefully lasts longer than my google pixel 6pro, which i broke in a bike fall.

Review: Received a phone a day after ordering overall the phone is pretty decent for the price that you pay. There are cosmetic damages here and there, particularly around The charge port and around the frame of the phone little dense here and there, but the phone itself is operational and functional.
And also the charger that comes in the box, it’s not even an Apple charger!!

Review: I purchased the (Product)Red 64GB version Refurbished - Excellent iPhone 12. When I received and unboxed the phone, I realized it looked brand new except what appears to be a small scratch at the bottom of the screen. Do I wish the scratch was on the back or anywhere else other than the screen? Sure but if that's the only blemish, I'm happy with it.

Not sure if this is standard but mine came with a screen protector installed which happens to hide the scratch pretty well making it difficult to notice unless you're looking right at it.

After I finished setting up and configuring the phone with T-Mobile, I checked the battery health. I would have been perfectly happy with a max capacity around 90% but to my surprise, it's 100%!!

I purchased a red set of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live that are refurbished but happen to look new as well to pair with the phone. They work perfectly together and the red color of both the phone and ear buds are a great match.

Overall, I really like this phone!! Maybe I got lucky with the condition but this is one of the better purchases I've made recently. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for a decent iPhone that can't afford a current model. I upgraded from an iPhone 8 so this a big leap from that. The differences between the newer models gets less and less as you move up to the 15 so getting the 12 is a really good option. The 12 even has the same shape and size as an iPhone 15.

Hope everyone who buys one gets a phone in like new condition like I did :)

Review: I am so pleased with my iphone 12 purchased from Amazon. I had been shopping for an unlocked iPhone on other sites then I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and I'm so glad I did. Amazon listed all the companies my unlocked phone was compatible with and my company was one of them. I also felt secure in knowing that if for some reason my cell company could not transfer my info from the old to the new phone, I could return it without any problems. The phone was a great value even the person at the cellular store asked where I bought it and how much I paid for it. When I told him, he even said it was a good deal. I am so very pleased with this purchase.

Review: I really do like the phone, I got the refurbished excellent quality, it charges relatively fast and dies just as fast, the main thing I cannot stand about it though is how fast it overheats, I’m unsure if this is just an iPhone 12 problem or whatever the case may be, but I do despise how due to it overheating it sometimes moves faster than the phone I replaced. Other than that it’s pretty okay. It’s an iPhone it’s everything you’d expect it to be.
----------------------------------------
Review: Only problem I had was the few scratches on the metal parts of the phone despite being in “Excellent” condition. Other than that everything’s perfect so far, 100% battery life and smooth processing.
----------------------------------------
Review: Satisfied with the quality of product received. The product had few scratches on the edges but with a hard cover, it wouldn’t appear. The battery health is also decent with battery percentage of 87%. I bought it for my mother and she loves using it.
----------------------------------------
Review: Condition 9.99/10. Tiny little nick beside the camera lens, other wise it looks flawless and works flawlessly. Battery health was over 90% like they said it would be.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this a couple months ago and it comes just like brand new. Not a scratch or defect. It works perfectly without and errors or defaults. The screen is very clear and high quality. It charges super fast with the charger it comes with and the battery lasts all day. It has some choices of some very nice colors, but I choose white to match the case I bought for it. It easily connects to your phone provider, your wifi, and any wireless headphones you may want to use.

Review: Product perfect - no problems
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was in perfect shape. Looked like new, battery was 100%. Although the iphone 11 comes in three versions. 1-USA, 2-Model sold in Hong Kong, and 3-International version. The differences are basically differences in some of the BANDS it supports. Google it if your not aware. It is kind of called the international version because is supports most of the carriers outside USA, as well as many carriers in USA. NOTE it does NOT support CDMA (where USA version does), so I do not believe it could be used for Verizon. So basically description is incorrect since it states supports verizon. Bottom line is phone was perfect but could be a problem for some people if they get the version I recieved. No real way to know if all the phones they send out are the international version or just luck of the draw which one you receive.

Review: Great phone works great genuine parts
----------------------------------------
Review: Tried to transfer my info to new phone and it wouldn’t work. Said it could not verify login. Super frustrating but decided to return and try a different phone. Amazon only offered a return if I can drop it off at Whole Foods. Usually I drop returns at ups store or even ship it myself if necessary. I contacted customer service to get another option for return but they said Whole Foods is the only option. Not sure why I would drive almost an hour (round trip) to return something that’s defective. Haven’t ever had this problem before. Hopefully we can get this return processed asap.

Review: Excellent product. Like new!
----------------------------------------
Review: I got my phone, paid a little more for the premium renewed. Got it in 2 days. No scratches on it, beautiful phone. It was easy to set up! It’s fast, durable phone. Comes with a 1 year warranty. I was scared to transition from android to iphone. But I'm glad i did!
----------------------------------------
Review: Being a little older, set up was more challenging than I remembered from my previous phone bought from Consumer Cellular
----------------------------------------
Review: Finally got a Renewed Premium phone with the over 90% battery health that is promised. Ordered the same phone each time (Apple iPhone 11, 128GB, White - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)). The first phone came with only 88% battery capacity (health). It could charge to 100%, but the health capacity only registered at 88%. Returned phone 1. The second phone had a battery error stating: "Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery. Health information not available for this battery." It could not display the battery health even though it displayed 100% charged (again, this is not the same thing as health). As the health could not be verified, returned phone 2. Finally, on the third try, received a phone with 100% battery health. I wasn't trying to get a 100% health phone, just wanted the >90% health as advertised. Each phone looked brand new and performed as expected, other than the battery health issues already noted.

One frustrating aspect of the Amazon Renewed for phones is that you can't take a return to a UPS drop off location. The phone to be returned MUST be picked up at the delivery address. Of course, there isn't a scheduled pickup time so you must plan to be home ALL DAY until UPS shows up (they'll try for 3 business days). Then there is a transit delay plus time needed to receive the phone into the renewal center to be evaluated by a tech person who hopefully can verify your issue and sign off on your refund. Then it's several days before the refund gets credited to your card. You could shorten this process if you just order a new phone as soon as you have a problem, but who wants to have hundreds of dollars in limbo for weeks without knowing if they'll accept your return for some reason? Just something to keep in mind if you're considering an Amazon Renewed phone.

The return process and associated delays were frustrating, but I am finally satisfied by getting the phone I wanted. It's a good deal if it can last and be free of glitches and battery degradation. Good luck!
