Review: Phone is fine, disappointed it took 12 days to get it.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was nearly in mint condition unlocked as stated in description with a clean serial number (no carrier payment delinquency lock,reported stolen, etc.) battery health in the mid 90’s. Only issue was it had a noticeable chip in the bezel. I did not return it however because outside of that there was no damage no scratches elsewhere on the phone’s body or screen and I didn’t want to deal with the return process when I knew it was never gonna be visible in a case anyways. Overall satisfied with the phone I got even if it wasn’t perfect.
----------------------------------------
Review: Works ok
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone looks great and works well. It is fully unlocked. There are a few scratches by the camera area but other than that the phone looks brand new. Very happy with my purchase 🤭
----------------------------------------
Review: I was really nervous when ordering this devices reading the reviews had me with mixed feelings. Nevertheless I received the device and it was just as the description said it would be!! I’m very pleased with the phone I received….
----------------------------------------
Review: It’s all well the only problem is the screen. It looks like it’s indented or pushed in it’s kind of weird but whenever I’m in the phone it doesn’t affect how it works and it looks normal. It only looks bad when I turned the phone off.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone works great but had to scrape and scrape and still residue. So frustrating!!!
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is as good as a brand new one. Small scratches around the camera lens, but not on the lens. I put a case on the phone and you don’t even see them. I don’t think I’ll buy brand new again. The savings was great!
----------------------------------------
Review: I’m going on two years with this phone. So far each phone that I’ve bought from Amazon have been good phones. I have apple care but haven’t had to use it. I would buy again if needed.
----------------------------------------
Review: At&t wanted to charge me $700. No thanks. This phone is perfect.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought this expecfing something pretty beat up, and it actually came in good quality! They left the prior owners tempered glass screen protector on, which made me afraid it had a cracked screen- but the glass under the screen protector is ok!

Does exactly what an iphone is expected to do, and came with a charger cable
----------------------------------------
Review: El envío llego super rápido, el teléfono tiene 3 marcas (pequeñas) en la parte frontal del marco. La pantalla está perfecta, la parte trasera excelente, las cámaras igual no hay rayaduras ni marcas. La batería esta al 100% viene desbloqueado
Condicion renovado:excelente
Solo por esos 3 tallones le hubiera dado 5 estrellas. Vino en caja de cartón genérica con su cable de carga
En la imagen se muestra con ranura para sim card y llego en e-sim.
----------------------------------------
Review: Not going to lie buying this phone I have bad expectations for it but it Amazed me how a refurbished phone can be in this condition I love it 🥰
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone looked brand new. It was hnlocked so we yook it to T Mobile and had his number transferred to this phone along with the pics and files from the iphone 8 to the new 14. It arrived quickly. I recommend this seller
----------------------------------------
Review: 
----------------------------------------
Review: Purchased refurbished iPhone14. Chose phone rated excellent condition. You would never know phone was not new. No scratches noted. Have had phone a couple months and couldn’t be more pleased. Phone was about half price of what it would have been new. I would never again buy a phone from one of the cell provider stores.
----------------------------------------
Review: All of this was experienced in the span of about 24-48 hours, and due to my work, I couldn’t keep the device because of the performance issues experienced:
I needed a phone quick because my last phone died. While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues.

For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed.
I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received.

Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours.
Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm.

Performance issues:
The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn’t always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn’t work and I’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. It’s not tight enough to keep a good connection.

There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. At times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop.

There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it.

The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall.

For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work.

Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.
----------------------------------------
Review: I’m glad that I got this phone. I was looking for iPhone with lower price and found this. I worried that it breaks or doesn’t work very well. But I’ve been using it for one year and still working great!
----------------------------------------
Review: It was time to upgrade my cell phone, so naturally I reached out to my carrier. They didn’t show a cash only price, just the amount of the monthly payment and for how many months. When I did the math I was astonished! I felt like there was a better deal to be had, I got my last iPad from Amazon, so I checked them out. For nearly HALF of what our carrier was asking, I purchased a renewed phone. It looks brand new and I’ve been enjoying it for several weeks now with flawless performance. I will never purchase new again!
----------------------------------------
Review: I felt in Love with this phone because it was my first iPhone a amazing price and it is the best one no damage or anything
----------------------------------------
Review: Amazing !! Used but still no scratches, marks, dent, etc. phone was in amazing condition. Will definitely buy from them again.
----------------------------------------
Review: We didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a brand new phone for my middle schooler. Great battery life, everything works properly, and we are pleased with this product.
----------------------------------------
Review: I definitely would recommend this phone.. But with that being said i will lay out the good and the bad of it.

Good:
- I ordered excellent and the phone came with absolutely no damage, scratches or anything. looked like a brand new phone.
- Speakers work perfect
- Camera works perfect
- phone runs very smoothly

Bad:
- phone wouldn’t let me transfer from my old phone, could easily be that my old phones an iphone 11 and not as high tech
- if you use straight talk, you can NOT do esim. went through hell to get my data transferred.
- phone would not let me connect to imessage at first, all i had to do was turn off imsg, power it off and back on and it started working.
- battery life is at 88%. but i also knew the risk when i bought the phone.

I will definitely say that the phone is amazing and i’m very glad i made the purchase, considering how i was very hesitant to purchase as it’s from Amazon and refurbished. I would recommend purchasing this phone. with that being said i advise if you’re looking to purchase this phone you do!!!

Review: Works well!
----------------------------------------
Review: When I received this phone, there was a small scratch on the front near the top corner. Once I put on the Tempered Glass Screen Protector, the scratch was not noticeable. Other than that, the phone works great and was easy to add to my service. The battery is in great shape and charges to 100% which will provide battery life all day. I would buy again from this seller.

----------------------------------------
Review: ¡Bien!
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone was in 98% great condition. Small issues. But overall happy with product.
----------------------------------------
Review: El teléfono está en excelentes condiciones internas pero cuando me llegó no trae el cargador solo el cable , hay que aclarar que es eSIM y tiene tecnología 5G. La pantalla traía varios arañazos cuando la condición decía que era excelente. Batería al 100% y trae todas sus partes supuestamente originales, detecta todo bien.
----------------------------------------
Review: I’m not gonna lie at first I was scared that I would receive a broken and dirty old phone but when it said “excellent condition” it meant excellent. It came in two days early and I was surprised to see it looked brand new with no scratches and bumps anywhere that I could see. The phone itself worked perfectly and came in at a nice 96% battery life so it’s not perfect but it’s up there. The box and accessories were kinda cheap and not so great but I was upgrading from my old iPhone SE so I had spares around. Overall as of I'm writing this,
this phone works perfectly fine and almost brand new, the price wasn’t the best but it was certainly cheaper than a brand new one. The only gripes I have is the phone came in kind of full of smudges from a wipe and it was a pain to set up the eSIM but it’s not too bad and just takes some effort. I would highly recommend buying this iPhone from this seller and I am probably gonna buy from here again when I need to upgrade but honestly I’m quite happy with my purchase.
----------------------------------------
Review: The condition of this phone was great! There are only two tiny scratches on the metal hoop surrounding the camera. Other than that it is just like new! It charges well, and connects to services perfectly. The camera, sound, and screen qualities are flawless!
----------------------------------------
Review: Wow! As some have said, this renewed iPhone is like new. I had my concerns, but the much lower price hooked me. I received the product in great condition and, importantly, with a 100% battery. The transfer of data from the old phone (XR) was flawless except for one thing - the eSIM did not transfer. I wasted about an hour trying to figure what I had done wrong, but a quick trip to T-Moble got that done in about 15 minutes. Flawless operation at a BIG savings. My concerns were without merit. Thank you Amazon for offering a great service! I have only had it in my possession for 24 hours, but, baring a big change in what I am seeing, all is good!
----------------------------------------
Review: It’s new…
----------------------------------------
Review: Updated review: I had to return this phone as it didn’t work properly after only having it about a month and a half. It would be fine for days to a week or so, but then would shut its self off randomly despite how much charge the phone had. Then would turn its self on, & repeat this process until the battery completely died & got very hot. This happened about 3 times before I was able to actually initiate the return. Even though I had to return the phone, I’m leaving 4 stars because customer service was great. I was able to get a complete refund very easily. They made the return process very quick & smooth & was issued a full refund as soon as they received the phone in the mail. I purchased from this seller in the past, & would still use this seller again.

This phone came in almost brand new condition. There was one super small 2 mm scratch on the screen, but it is not deep, barely noticeable & does not affect function.
Cameras are great, battery life came at 99%, holds a charge very well!!
Overall great phone, & got here quick.
It did not come with an Apple charger, but the listing says that it does not. This is not a big deal to me at all, as I have a bunch laying around. This is the second time I’ve bought a phone off Amazon & I have not been disappointed either time (the last one lasted 6 years & I just upgraded to this iphone).
----------------------------------------
Review: This iPhone 14 has been great! upon getting the phone, I noticed that you could not tell that it was renewed, looks great, runs just like a new phone, and does exactly what I need it to do. A bonus of the phone is so much cheaper buying renewed vs. brand new,
----------------------------------------
Review: I love my purple iPhone 14, it works perfectly and I had no problems with it. I love it
----------------------------------------
Review: Like most, I was skeptical about ordering refurbished. I have ordered refurbished/renewed in the past and of course it’s give and take! The first thing I did when I received my phone was look for cosmetic issues. There was barely any at all! The phone looks practically new! I had a iPhone 12 mini and wanted something a little bigger/upgrade. Everything transferred flawlessly. I made test calls with no issue. Good speaker sound, runs smooth and it came charged at 91% and has 100 percent battery capacity which was awesome! I received the phone on the 27th and it has been working great! I will keep this seller in mind for any future references! If you have any second guesses, no worries! I read the reviews before purchasing. There were more good than bad. You always take a chance buying renewed devices, but according to the reviews, anyone who had to return a device did so with no issues and always received good replacements. I hope this information helps for anyone needing a refurbished device at a great cost!
----------------------------------------
Review: good
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought this after my daughter dropped her phone in the lake. It was priced reasonable and arrived looking brand new. Everything functions as it should.
----------------------------------------
Review: I would have liked it better if it had a nice case and a stylus to go with it ,or earbuds considering the price I paid.
----------------------------------------
Review: Came in really good condition. My son loves it! Great phone!
----------------------------------------
Review: Great
----------------------------------------
Review: Good phone - good price.
Is a fancy Apple box worth $400?
You choose.
----------------------------------------
Review: excelente
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought the starlight 128 gb in acceptable condition for $380.76. Considering other reviews, I was worried that the phone would be beat up or have major problems. To my surprise, the phone has not even one scratch or dent. It’s completely perfect! The cameras work well and have great quality, and the charging capacity is at 95%
----------------------------------------
Review: 👍🏼 Battery life / good condition
----------------------------------------
Review: When the phone came it looked brand new and it still does. I got the blue one in excellent condition and I don’t see any scratches or problems. The percentage health came with 97% and is really good. I test it on an app called tester and everything passed. Overall it’s really good.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone overall looks nice no scratches anywhere however the battery health was 75% I noticed after first initial charge it was over heating. I will see how it does in a few more weeks.
----------------------------------------
Review: Immediately after taking it from the box I started looking for scratches and blemishes couldn’t find any. It came in bubble wrap in a small box with the packing slip and a new usb cable. Should have come 8/30 but it came on 8/28. I’m super satisfied with my purchase as I turned it on and transferred my items from my phone. Now to get the perfect case.
----------------------------------------
Review: The camera quality, battery life, and sound quality are just as if the item is brand new! Well worth the money saved and have no worries about buying another refurbished item from Amazon.

The phone itself is great, no heat, easy to use, and great size.
----------------------------------------
Review: The refurbished phone I bought had a defect with the camera, but they issued me a full refund the next day. No issues with the company. They seem like they really care about customer service.
----------------------------------------
Review: Keep in mind that this is my first time buying a refurbished or "renewed" item ever. As such, I wanted to buy the a phone in the best condition possible, because buying refurbished for me is more about morality than price. I just also want my phone to look nice.

The phone was clear of scratches on the actual screen, but the outer shell had scrapes along the bottom and sides. There also seemed to be a scratch or scrape around the camera, but everything appeared to be in working order. The battery was 100% so I can't complain about that. For me, I just felt if I was paying so much money I want the product to look the best it can on the exterior as well. The return was easy. The seller does NOT do exchanges. They were very professional. If you don't mind a few scratches for the price, then I think you'll be satisfied. Might not be for me, but it is for somebody.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought the “good” version. Expecting some scratches because of the new reviews but my iPhone had no scratches at all, packaged well. Doesn’t come with the chargers but that’s no problem bc I have so many at home. Love the blue. Came in only a few days. I bought mine unlocked and it’s been great. Would recommend!!
----------------------------------------
Review: I got the phone 4 days earlier than expected and it came packaged nice and protected. It also came with a charger and instructions for return if needed. It was dead when I received it but once it powered on I was able to set it up. As for as the esim goes everything moved over perfectly , though at first I wasn’t able to switch my number over in the initial set up but after I finished and it opened to home screen it asked again about moving over the number and it did switch over . Phone is giving me no issues at all. This is a great buy!
----------------------------------------
Review: Got it today, delivered 1 day earlier than promised (thank you!). Clean and in great condition. Transfered my info from old phone easily. So far, happy with my purchase.
----------------------------------------
Review: Cumplió con lo solicitado
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought the excellent quality IPhone 14 128gb and the shipment arrived 2 business days after UPS picked it up. The phone was in near perfect condition minus a few scratches on the screen. However, they’re impossible to see unless you’re in direct sunlight. The main reason why this wasn’t an issue for me is that the phone came with 98% of original battery capacity. Would highly recommend this company for refurbished phones. The only way you’d be disappointed is if you’re unlucky and get a phone that was previously abused by another consumer.
----------------------------------------
Review: Just as good as new. Not a scratch on it and in perfect condition.
----------------------------------------
Review: Everything is ok except the speaker.
----------------------------------------
Review: No dings, scratches, dents or anything. Can’t tell it’s refurbished. Unlocked like it said. Had for a good 2 weeks now and no issues so far. Came with a charger and screen protector. Upgraded from an iPhone 11. Had a little trouble connecting to my carrier as this phone is esim only and my old phone had a physical sim. I use straight talk and they got it straightened out in about 30mins to an hour.
----------------------------------------
Review: It did have some scratches and a ding or two but it’s expected for a refurbished device. The functionality is pretty consistent overall and as I stated it has a couple of scratches but from there it looks and performs good.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was purchased to be in excellent condition and I would agree. It arrived and appears new with 100% battery life at time of purchase. The navy blue color is unique which I appreciate. The iPhone 13 works well and I have no concerns. I would use this company again for a refurbished phone. I appreciate that I can pay in full instead of having a payment plan through AT&T.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone's in good shape. Everything seems to work. 85% battery life, same as everyone else has reported.

The charging cord arrived cut almost in half. Its little sealed bag was undamaged, as was the packaging of the phone, suggesting the cord was cut sometime prior to bagging. Every wire had been severed.
----------------------------------------
Review: Ordered the iPhone 13 in Midnight for T-Mobile. the phone came in near perfect condition with minor scratches on the camera area (doesn’t affect camera / picture quality at all). the phone came with a preinstalled glass screen protector. i was especially surprised and pleased by the 96% battery health!! definitely a gamble when it comes to buying refurbished / renewed phones but it ended up working out. the second hand seller i purchased through was Synergy, paid $377 (including tax). little more than half the price than a new phone is totally worth it. also did a fair amount of research and apparently the iphone 14 and 13 are the same exact product, so would recommend buying the 13 to save some money!
----------------------------------------
Review: This review is based on the product quality and condition. So this phone came nice and neat. No scratches or visible ware and tear. Easy to program and unlock. The only detail i saw was that the battery life was below 83%, meaning that it wasn’t replaced for a fresher one. So I’m expecting it to be changed sooner. All its functions seem to work fine. Haven’t had issues with Apple (since Apple’s notorious fame of disabling features when phone don’t have genuine parts). I think this is a good vender to buy your phone when budget is tight.
----------------------------------------
Review: My package came yesterday and was worried it wasn’t going to work, but to my surprise it worked well like a brand new phone. The only thing it had was some minor scratches but you can barely see it. Overall the phone works and looks just about right.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is great, there is a few scratches, none are actually visible except for one tiny one. The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is. Good product, terrible delivery.
----------------------------------------
Review: the phone came in very fast, the delivery said it wouldn't be here until around halloween and it came in yesterday. the phone came in super nice minor scratch on the bottom, speakers work, all 3 microphones work. the problem came in when i started to set up the phone. i went through the entire process and got to the part to transfer everything from my other phone to this one and it told me i had to update it. i could not get the phone to update. i let it sit in the update screen for 2 hours and it did not start to update. i had to set up the phone with no transferring to update it. after that i erased the phone again and was finally able to transfer all of my stuff. it was definitely a struggle but i finally got it and am very happy.
----------------------------------------
Review: So let me start out by saying that I am not one to purchased refurbished phones and whenever something would happen to one of mine and I had to turn it into the Phone company and they would send me a refurbished one to replace mine, there was always something wrong with them. So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.
With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.
I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.
I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.
After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.
In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.
And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.
So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.
Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…
----------------------------------------
Review: Fast shipping and product as expected other than I got the wrong color. Ordered a red phone, got a blue one. I didn't return it, as the medium blue color was nice looking, and I needed the phone asap. Fortunately, the specs/memory were the same 256GB. Phone had some dings on the edges of the body, but they all disappeared once I put a case on it. I didn't expect it to be 100% and a few dings were worth the better price.
