Review: The phones are great the only problem is I got one with 90% battery and the other with 80% battery. The one with 80% dies at 10% that‚Äôs the only problem and the one with 90% is good no problem. Got them with no scratches they look brand new, I have no problem charging them and I don‚Äôt use the charger they came with I use Apple Original charger.
----------------------------------------
Review: Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition. If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right. There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case). If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear. However, the phone was not sold as "flawless" so some wear and tear is to be expected. For my use case, the phone met my needs. I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch. I haven't pulled off the screen protector to see if the underlying screen has scratches. if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector. Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.
----------------------------------------
Review: This product was good considering it being a refurbished phone the phone was intact other than the side scratches around the phone. I use a case anyways so it‚Äôs not noticeable. Phone was sent with a charger and a charging box but the box was the wrong one so I had to purchase a new one since the phone was dead when it arrived and I wanted to make sure it worked. Phone froze once but other than that it was worth it .
----------------------------------------
Review: If you are reading this you‚Äôre more than likely considering buy this phone because of the price and reading the reviews on hope of validating your purchase, I recently bought this phone last Friday( Iphone 13 Light blue, ocean blue idk it‚Äôs blue ok) and received it around 4pm yesterday so only about 5 days to receive it 2 days before it was scheduled to arrive, and I guess hit the jackpot; it came without scratches, dents, and the Iphone battery itself at 94-100. As a college student this was definitely worth my purchase and I hope you future buyers receive something just as good if not better , will write another review in about 2 months

Review: Me lleg√≥ con un 86 de capacidad de bater√≠a y veo que a otros le lleg√≥ m√°s alta. ü•≤est√° bello. Como nuevo est√©ticamente
----------------------------------------
Review: This was my first time buying a refurbished phone, so I was nervous about what I might get, but a couple of days in, I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.

First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust.

The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!
----------------------------------------
Review: at the beginning i was quit disappointed cause the product doe not correspond to the situation "excellen". There are many scars and bettery life is just 83%. In fact the condition in my opinion is just "OK". however, i was not in the US and not able to return since this one is bought for someone else. It is not possible for me to return it. However, the customer service help me to solve the problem and gave me a good solution about it.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone works great so far, it is unlocked and it is great physical condition no marks or dings as far as i can tell.I'm very satisfied as of now if anything changes i will update the review.
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought this phone as a gift for my mom and she loves it!!
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought an excellent condition but the camera is scratched. Lots of dirt at the bottom of the screen.( between edge of the screen and the body). I expected an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äùcondition since I spent more for an excellent condition.
----------------------------------------
Review: This was a nice gift for one of our kids. He really enjoys his new phone. It‚Äôs fast has great cameras in an 80% battery life still on it. This was a very reasonable price compared to buying a new one. The phone came in very nice shape as well. It should last us a long time!
----------------------------------------
Review: Great condition, 100% battery and NO scratches
----------------------------------------
Review: Update: Due to this phone I will most likely never buy a nee phone ever again and will only ever buy used. This thing is great the battery while at 87% as stated in my one week review still lasts all day one charge. If you‚Äôre on the fence of getting a used iPhone don‚Äôt be it‚Äôs a great way to save some hard earned cash without sacrificing much.

Currently one week into owning this phone and will update again after a month or so. I ordered the excellent condition version and it came in just that, excellent condition aside from a few dings to the side and one small unnoticeable scratch on the screen and back of the phone.

Battery health came at 87% as promised by the excellent condition info in the Amazon renewed/refurbished info area. Which the IPhone 13 will be supported by apple until 2028 so if the battery does get below 80% by then I will just get a replacement battery which isn‚Äôt that expensive so this phone is still a great deal.

Lastly everything works as it should and I have no complaints right sound is great too.
----------------------------------------
Review: So far the phone is working well. Only minor dings on corners, battery only 87% but knew that was a possibility when ordering it. Reason for only 4 stars is it was shipped early and delivered without any advanced notice and sat outside on porch for 1/2 day. I know it was delivery Fed Ex that is responsible for letting know it arrives but would of been watching the day of delivery if would of known.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone itself functions perfectly, but for the price, it came with scratches, which was not appreciated.
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered this product on august 5th day of item received was august 7th. The delivery was fast and unexpected but im not complaining. I purchased excellent quality and thats what i got beside a few minor scratches that you cant see when the case is on this phone is amazing. The screen works well. The sound quality is perfect. And the overall appearance is flawless. I transitioned to a iPhone after having an 11 and the size is smaller but it worked out perfectly because i have small hands all the touchscreen censors work well nothing is laggy. Updating the phone does take a while but it depends on your internet i was able to set the whole phone up within a hour
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone arrived in decent condition and quickly. Battery capacity is only at 84% and the charging port is loose so it will need work eventually done on it eventually. I'm not sure if the color is correct it looks more like the starlight color than pink to me which I guess isn't too big of a deal other than the price difference. Otherwise I'm happy with the phone so far and it serves its purpose.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone works good and looked good. Only grip is the previous owner name is still in phone and I haven‚Äôt been able to delete
----------------------------------------
Review: I liked it on sight because it was Red! I needed a phone asap, a that‚Äôs the one I settled on. I read reviews after reviews, I was skeptical of a refurbished, but price was really the deciding factor. Perfect condition also. As cited.
----------------------------------------
Review: I will say that I was very skeptical while trying to find this phone. I was actually little horrified. But after reading other great reviews it turned great. The phone works like new and there were no visible blemishes or issues. I have a had it for a while now and I love it. Battery was also good! I would definitely purchase from the seller again.
----------------------------------------
Review: I like the phone. It replaced my iPhone 8 that started messing up...lol. I was not about to go buy an Iphone 16 for over a thousand dollars. This phone is working well. The battery life was a little over 85% (thought it would be at least over 90%). Overall I give it a thumbs up.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone worked just like it should
----------------------------------------
Review: When receiving my phone the only issue I had was transferring everything over but I‚Äôm not sure if it was a phone issue or WiFi issue. I do however love this phone and it is working great. It came in a little scratched but nothing a case couldn‚Äôt hide. The back of the phone does have a pattern from the past phone case it had on but it isn‚Äôt super noticeable. They battery health was at 89% and now 3 months into having it, it is at 84%. Overall, I love this phone and don‚Äôt regret the purchase!
----------------------------------------
Review: Has 85% battery life but it got here quick and no scratches no problems. I‚Äôll post again if something happens with it but so far it‚Äôs working great.
----------------------------------------
Review: I was VERY reluctant to buy a phone off Amazon. Being a cellphone professional, I would never recommend it. I took a chance for the price and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Upgraded from a IPhone XS to the iPhone 13. I know it‚Äôs still out dated but I don‚Äôt want to spend an arm and a leg on it and it works for what I need it to. Absolutely no scratches. No cracks. Works perfect. Battery is decent. Small tough wear and tear around camera circles on back. But if that‚Äôs the only blemish, great. Thank you for being a honest trustworthy company.

The only downside was, it says it included a usb-c to lightening cord. It did not. It came with usb-a to lightening cord. Not a huge problem. I‚Äôm glad it came with a charger in general.
----------------------------------------
Review: I purchased this for my son‚Äôs girlfriend. She was more than thrilled. It has been working great and she really loves it. Thank you! Highly recommended this seller.
----------------------------------------
Review: No complaints. Came with a screen protector on too. Nice phone nice color good condition no issues. Love the camera quality
----------------------------------------
Review: I purchased the iPhone 13 128GB unlocked. It arrived on time and is in amazing condition, basically brand new. It is worth every penny. Battery capacity is at 88% which is satisfactory for me. It also came with a charging cord, a base, and a pin to open the SIM card tray. I am very happy with my new phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: First time buying a renewed phone and after 2 1/2 hours at Verizon with them trying to trouble shoot it, there‚Äôs a parental lock on it so it‚Äôs useless to me so they say. Came home and requested to return it but decided to talk to tech support. After a few minutes she helped get it straightened out.
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered the iphone 13 in product red. Phone arrived on time no scratches or dents came in perfect condition.. only thing that bothers me is the battery percentage its at 84%. Phone works good as new definitely would recommend going the renewed route to save money
----------------------------------------
Review: Overall it is a good phone, just a dent to the top of the phone , the battery was 99% I‚Äôm still shocked, performance is 100%, camera quality is great , appearance it is so cute, color shows midnight but it look kinda navy blue up close. Overall it is good just the dents have me feeling some way
----------------------------------------
Review: So I liked that the phone was clean the only problem was the scratch around the screen and the volume isn‚Äôt loud
----------------------------------------
Review: slight damage but in great condition, battery 85%.... only nitpick was the phone was already set up and had to do a system reset to make sure no unwanted software was installed... no big problem I would buy these phones again
----------------------------------------
Review: Celular vino n√≠tido, la bater√≠a al 96%, ven√≠a con su cable, cargador y hasta con vidrio templado la pantalla
----------------------------------------
Review: I was pleasantly surprised! For a refurbished phone it looks great and works even better! Would highly recommend üëçüèª
----------------------------------------
Review: It doesn't get any better than this.
It look new.
----------------------------------------
Review: Got this as a replacement for an XR that wouldn‚Äôt stay charged and just to update the phone for a teenager. It‚Äôs hit & miss with battery health but we got 100% on this one. Phone is in great condition & came with a screen protector already on it so that saved me the hassle of doing it!! Phone set up was quick & simple.
----------------------------------------
Review: pain in the neck to transfer apple data but i got it done
----------------------------------------
Review: It is worth the price. Wasn‚Äôt even expecting my battery health to be 100%. It came in new, with no scratch, good camera too. Thank you so much Amazon. At least Amazon is reliable, so if you don‚Äôt like a delivered product you can still reach out to them, send it back and get a refund or buy something else. You aren‚Äôt losing at all.
----------------------------------------
Review: This was a great buy for me and the phone works extremely well so far. For a refurbished phone, it looks brand new. I was so glad to able to get an updated smartphone for just under $400 with plenty of space (256MB). Although it reads five stars, I reluctantly give it 4.85. Only reason is because the battery health is at 86%. Yes I know that's still good, but would have been nice if it was above 90%, but hey you can't get everything when you buy second hand (LOL). Overall, I'm very happy with it!!
----------------------------------------
Review: My phone is excellent like new cant complain.
----------------------------------------
Review: Just a few scratches over the Camera.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone works great and it has no defects or problems.
----------------------------------------
Review: It came within a day of ordering it! It was packaged nicely and safely. I got the pink color and I absolutely love it! It did come with no charge but after like 5 minutes it was up and running. Very easy to just place my SIMs card it it and everything switched over! Overall very good deal and price! I highly recommend getting one!
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought this iPhone 13 to replace a SE. I was a bit skeptical but I have been surprised at the quality of this phone. Battery charge is great and the functionality of the phone is like new. The cosmetics of the phone is good. Signal strength is great. I wish it came with more directions as I was thinking I needed to have a SIM card, but I did not. The transition from the SE to 13 is smooth- basically the phone walks you through the set up of the new phone & resetting of the old phone- it‚Äôs pretty slick actually.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is in a very good condition:
No damages, the screen is clean and fine.
The battery is 84% which is not good.
The phone performs and functions normally, the phone looks good but their is some scratches around the frame of the camera (not on the lens of the camera) doesn't affect the camera. Overall a good deal.
----------------------------------------
Review: The bottom of the phone came cracked
----------------------------------------
Review: El iphone recibido se encontraba en buenas condiciones, solamente algunas peque√±as rayas en la parte trasera, pr√°cticamente imperceptibles. Conforme con el producto.
----------------------------------------
Review: I was hesitant on buying something refurbished but so far so good. I set the pickup to a locker so i had no worries if it would get taken. It works pretty good and it‚Äôs unlocked so i was able to use with metro pcs.

Only problem i have had is it shutting down at like 3,5, or 7% but that may be a feature of this phone idk
----------------------------------------
Review: LOVE the phone, I was using an old iPhone X that had a terrible battery life and not enough storage. Now I'm doing great again. Phone does what it's supposed to do. However, when I opened the package there was a small but deep scratch at the bottom of the screen. Not the condition I was promised. Amazon gave me a partial refund (could have also gotten a replacement if I wanted to go that route). So it worked out I guess.
----------------------------------------
Review: Was on an iPhone 12 before and the speed improvement in opening apps etc. was noticeable! The screen size is just fine too, not too big and def not too big for pant pockets :)
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered this product not knowing what to expect but it came in really good condition. Only wished the battery health was a bit more but it's fine. There were minor scratches on the edge that are only recognizable up close but a phone case would hid it just fine.
----------------------------------------
Review: I was has to buy the refurbished one but these come just like the new one and even came with the cable and an adapter. So thankful for the adapter no scratch hundred percent functional just like new only difference is that it didn‚Äôt came with the original box but who cares
----------------------------------------
Review: In September 2024, I purchased a renewed Apple Iphone 13, when it arrived I (as always) put a glass protector on the phone before starting it up. When I placed the glass protector on the screen, the glass protector would not adhere around the edges of the screen (yes, the two dust dots in the middle of the screen are my fault in the picture above). I have not seen this problem before but it looked like a liquid must have damaged the screen under the prior owner(s). Battery capacity for a used phone was fine at 86%, one of the camera lenses had a scratch right through the middle. Perhaps this is the difference between Amazon renewed and premium renewed. Other than the inconvenience of sending it back for exchange, I have purchased other renewed items and this is not major disappointment because of the return policy.
----------------------------------------
Review: Perfect just as described
----------------------------------------
Review: I like the size
----------------------------------------
Review: Decent phone for the price, Screen has many scratches but it‚Äôs what you get for what you pay. You can cover them up with a screen protector. There‚Äôs two little tiny chips but nothing major. Back of the phone is perfect. Battery came at 94% battery health so very good for its price. Both speakers work. Screen works perfect. Camera has good quality. If you don‚Äôt mind the screen being scratched upped than you should look into getting this phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: Only detail battery health 88%, not great but still as expected
----------------------------------------
Review: No scratch on display part of front. A hairline scratch on bezel. 3 dents along rim. A lower price on the excellent scale and scruff scratches on rear. Clear previous owner did not use case. For functionality like new as with new case any of the dents are hidden
----------------------------------------
Review: I‚Äôve had this phone since April 11th and I could say it‚Äôs a pretty good phone , it works as it‚Äôs supposed to, the only thing bad about this phone is that it came with minor scratches ! But don‚Äôt worry the scratches weren‚Äôt that bad and you could honestly barely even tell unless you really are looking deeply into the phone. It was also to be expected since it‚Äôs refurbished versus if the phone was brand spanking new it would have zero scratches. But if I were to purchase a brand new phone overtime I would have had scratches on the phone anyways so it didn‚Äôt bother me as much. I wanted to wait to give it a review to see how things were for me but overall it‚Äôs a fair purchase for a used phone, it would have gotten a 5/5 only because it did come a little dirty around the bottom microphone part but a good wipe and it was good! It‚Äôs now June and I‚Äôve had it for 3 months and nothing I mean absolutely nothing is wrong with this phone!
----------------------------------------
Review: Very happy with the iphone purchase. It was listed in excellent condition and it was. The iphone 13 was scratch free and arrived with 87% battery. For a used phone that's a few years old I think this is excellent. It came boxed, with a charging cord and wall adapter. Very impressed with the phone, the condition and the packing. I would buy from this seller again.
----------------------------------------
Review: Arrived on time, the phone is perfect! Set up was very easy and I am thrilled. Thank you
----------------------------------------
Review: Buen equipo quedo super contento mi hijo
----------------------------------------
Review: For a good price I was feel like I received a new iPhone 13. The outer case and screen is like new. Works perfectly. The battery is degraded to 80%, but that is very acceptable as this my secondary phone for traveling only.
----------------------------------------
Review: It came in great condition and is super easy to use. The only thing about is it doesn't use a physical S.D card so that was surprising üòÖüòÖ
----------------------------------------
Review: Love my pink iPhone 13
----------------------------------------
Review: I like how it‚Äôs clear design reveals the nice color of my iPhone 14.
----------------------------------------
Review: Works really well like a brand new phone only just a few lil scratches on the edges but otherwise I love it
Great packaging also
----------------------------------------
Review: Very cute and it said fair but nothing was wrong with the phone at all!!!! it works really well
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone was in good condition but flash light did not work. I hope it doesn‚Äôt affect the camera flash.
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered the iphone 13 (pink 128gb) in acceptable condition. I always find these to be the best value and i WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED !

Amazon promises that acceptable comes with at least 80% Battery health - mine came with 92% ! Unreal!

Minimal wear and tear on the phone. Looks and feels new!

(also came with overnight delivery)
----------------------------------------
Review: Minor scuffs and scratches. Charging port was dirty and I had to clean it.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone was delivered on time, the packaging is not original. The phone works, so far there are no complaints, but the charger that came with the kit does not charge the phone. Therefore, there are doubts about the authenticity of this product. Was it really impossible to include a normal cable?
----------------------------------------
Review: Very happy with this phone. Looks (almost) brand new. Battery is at 93% Would buy again. Not sure why but red seems to be the cheapest color.
----------------------------------------
Review: phone is like brand new condition, very pleaded with it. Thank you
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone is for every day use. It seems good, battery life said 100%. So far only had to charge it once . Shipping was fast
----------------------------------------
Review: Hi. I bought this product in 'excellent' condition and noticed shortly after the 90 day refund period that the charging port became finicky..

There wasn't any lint in the port, so I think it has something to do w/ the connectors. The phone works great otherwise. The battery life is comparable to my old iPhone that was 5+ yrs old (maybe the battery technology hasn't increased substantially during that time period).

I'd still recommend but be mindful of the 90-day return policy. Thanks for reading.
----------------------------------------
Review: Was as advertised. No flaws. No scratches. Battery 87 %. Note ,as suggestion ,update to most current operating system before transfer of data.
----------------------------------------
Review: I bought the excellent version of the iPhone 13 and the phone is amazing. The battery life is fairly good with 87% and there aren't any scratches, scuffs, or dents. It was a little dirty in on the sides and around the camera but it came off easily.

The shipping & delivery process was horrible and the worst I've ever experienced. Although Amazon was as helpful as they could be during the process, UPS was very unhelpful and inconvenient. Somehow my address was messed up they didn't provide any help or updates. I ultimately had to go get the phone myself.
----------------------------------------
Review: Le pongo 3 estrellas porque el tema de cargador no me anduvo bien. De la nada me salta un cartel de ‚ÄúCharging not available‚Äù y mi celular nunca estuvo expuesto a lugares con agua o humedad. De hecho siempre que me ba√±o, NUNCA dejo el celular en el ba√±o. Esto me apareci√≥ al segundo d√≠a que us√© el celular nuevo. Es raro, debe ser una falla del sensor. Despu√©s dejo de aparecer y el celular me cargo bien pero cada tanto me tira el cartel. A ra√≠z de esto, me compr√© un cargador inal√°mbrico y esta todo Ok. Igual con el cargador de cable tambi√©n me anda pero de la nada pira y tira ese cartel, pasa cuando paso cerca de un ba√±o que quiz√°s alguien se ba√±√≥, pero es raro. Lo peor de todo es que lo compr√© refurbished pero en excelente condiciones. Esto no deber√≠a pasar. Ademas vivo en Argentina y no estoy en USA para poder arreglarlo o quejarme con Amazon. El resto del celular anda todo ok, esto del cargador me pasa cada tanto, pero no deber√≠a pasarme!! Eso
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone has a couple very minor scratches. Came with a screen protector already installed. Battery health was at 100%. I will never buy a phone from the carrier again
----------------------------------------
Review: Llevo 2 meses us√°ndolo y la verdad que muy buen producto, llego al 100% de condici√≥n, a nivel est√©tico impecable 10/10
----------------------------------------
Review: I was nervous about the buy, but it was definitely a great one the phone has no visible marks the camera lens are clear and prefect the performance is fast it was easy to set up. My only complaint is when using the device gets really hot I would have to put it down to cool off I‚Äôm not sure if this will be a later issue overall I love the look of it
----------------------------------------
Review: Tiene da√±os por uso muy evidentes bater√≠a se consume s√∫per r√°pido
----------------------------------------
Review: La condici√≥n de la bater√≠a muy buena, un detalle en uno de los bordes pero realmente muy contento con este nuevo tel√©fono 8/10
----------------------------------------
Review: I mistakenly ordered to many of one thing I needed and returned a few with no problems. And phone that I received works great.
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone arrived decent the charger after two days started having shortage problems. I instantly contacted Amazon they informed me they‚Äôd contact the seller for a new charger or a partial refund I have not heard back from the seller at all. Amazon says my only option is to return the phone. I brainstormed phones and retailers for months this is NOT the solution I wanted. I‚Äôve put all of my business apps and Apple login on the phone now I have to remove all of it and stop work again. This is going to be a huge hassle. I have to send the entire phone back because of a charger. Which I will be doing.
----------------------------------------
Review: I knew ordering a refurbished phone was a bit of a gamble but I wasn't disappointed! I got the red iPhone 13 and when it came in all I really noticed were a couple of little cosmetic buffs here and there along the edges and around the cameras but it's hardly noticeable and not a big deal to me. The battery health since I received it has been 90% which was better than I expected! I've been pretty happy with it.
----------------------------------------
Review: For good condition, I would say it was almost in excellent condition, except for one major thing. There were severe dents all around the body, as well as around the cameras. The screen and camera lenses were in peak condition, and came with a 90% battery life (far better than expected). It also came with a screen protector already put on which was nice. It came 2 days earlier than expected as well! For what you pay for, it‚Äôs pretty nice!
----------------------------------------
Review: MUY CARO PARA SER USADO...
----------------------------------------
Review: For starters; the price on these phones is great. Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it‚Äôs well worth it.

I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine into the sink ‚òπÔ∏è Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.

I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn‚Äôt wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.

Okay.... that‚Äôs not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was‚Ä¶.bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way. 32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that‚Äôs on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad‚Äôs)

I scoured FB marketplace. I‚Äôd decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch. I didn‚Äôt want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat‚Äôs recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.

Marketplace had plenty. Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. ‚ÄúThis person seems too eager‚Äù, ‚Äúthis one has been posted so long‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space‚Äù and ‚Äúthe pretty green one has a small crack‚Äù, ‚Äúthis guy lives 2 hours from me‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?‚Ä¶.no, I can‚Äôt take a screenshot of it, it‚Äôs turned off‚Äù‚Ä¶. ‚Äúcash only please‚Äù Etc.

So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn‚Äôt work? That‚Äôs $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn‚Äôt want to get scammed, and I also didn‚Äôt want to settle.

That‚Äôs when I remembered good ol‚Äô Amazon. Maybe I‚Äôd check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn‚Äôt hurt.

Sure enough, refurbished devices selling ‚Äúlike new!‚Äù Mostly same cost or less than what I‚Äôd found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!

I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12‚Äôs don‚Äôt come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!!

As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g‚Äôs, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some ‚Äúsmall scratches‚Äù

Once my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.

Oh no.
The FACE ID DIDNT WORK üò≠

After becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks‚Äî I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.

Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that‚Äôs true, but I needed Face ID!!

I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That‚Äôs almost what I paid for the whole phone!!

I realllllly didn‚Äôt want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.

So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she send a message to them. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we‚Äôll make this right‚Äù she encouraged.

I‚Äôm ngl. I was nervous. I didn‚Äôt have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn‚Äôt till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the 7. I could make do in the meantime.

The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.

As I‚Äôd anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.

I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.

Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green‚Ä¶.* ü´¢ SHOCK
‚Äú‚Ä¶do you have purple‚Äù
No. :( just blue, white, and black.

THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It‚Äôs silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems ‚Äú.. but I mean‚Ä¶. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person‚Ä¶out $350‚Ä¶ because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus, I‚Äôd already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.

It wasn‚Äôt even a fun blue‚Ä¶ it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow üò≠üò≠ no luck,

They told me they‚Äôd be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.

Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.

No. I wasn‚Äôt ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn‚Äôt, *then* I would choose from the options available.

I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer‚Ä¶. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.

They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.

they‚Äôd said overnight shipping‚Ä¶ but wow! I‚Äôd dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn‚Äôt even have my new case yet üòÖ

Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I‚Äôm actually sort of glad the green didn‚Äôt work out.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the green is also gorgeous.. but in the end I‚Äôm glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.

Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all‚Ä¶ ITS PURPLE!

Can‚Äôt wait to pair it with the new case. I‚Äôm so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.

I‚Äôm grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preference

If you‚Äôre nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they‚Äôll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.

Review: My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people. I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it. It is on a carrier that is not one of the "big names". It suits my purposes fine.
My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe. This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there. Believe me, I tried. The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone. I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.
I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering. I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating. They did not disappoint!
The first phone I purchased was purple. It arrived in excellent condition visually. No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone. It charged up to 82% which was great. Everything was wonderful. Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user). I couldn't hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.
I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion. Nope, wasn't me.
MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone. They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me. The replacement phone was blue, but that isn't an issue. It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new. It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.
This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.
My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a "new" phone and to do your research on sellers. Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from.
Hope that helps.

Review: I purchased a refurbished iPhone 12, and overall, I‚Äôm quite satisfied with my experience. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my thoughts:

Performance: The A14 Bionic chip delivers impressive performance. Everything from browsing to gaming has been smooth and responsive. I‚Äôm glad I chose this model‚ÄîI can easily multitask without any noticeable lag.

Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren‚Äôt mentioned in the description. While they don‚Äôt impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing.

Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations.

Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance.

Value for Money: Considering the savings compared to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it‚Äôs a solid option.

In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone. Just be sure to check the condition carefully beforehand. Happy with my purchase overall!

Review: First of all I bought the phone and the description said EVERYTHING IS FUNTIONAL and keep in mind i bought the one that said EXCELLENT condition. Even so, the phone upon arrival smelled weird firstly llike as if it had mold on it. Secondly the phonewas dirty near teh ringer and alot of cracks and crevices. I used a needle and alcohol to clean everything. That being the speakers and teh microphones were SUPER low and so I figured maybe it was dirty so I cleaned it well and after that speaker was perfect. BUT the earspeaker STILL didnt work and was completely useless. In addition I charged teh phone while transferring all th detailas and what not and after that I left the phone to charge up. I waited until a hundred percent and used it for an hour and THE BATTERY DRAINED 40 PERCENT IN ONE HOUR unbelievable as this was supposed to be a "EXCELLENT" condition phone clearly not and reading other reviews other people have had similar issues. Other then that the phone is great no scratches or whatnot everything software wise functioned great so a three star for that.

Review: I recently purchased the Apple iPhone 12, 128GB, in Blue, fully unlocked and renewed, from a seller on Amazon. The phone arrived in Las Vegas via FedEx from New York in just four days, and the condition was generally good. It had minor scratches along the sides and a few on the screen, which was expected with a renewed product. However, the battery was only at 74% health, which was disappointing since it caused the screen to turn off occasionally and the battery to overheat.

I contacted the seller through Amazon, and they offered three options: a full replacement of the phone, a refund, or covering the cost of a battery replacement at an official Apple store. I chose the battery replacement and went to an Apple store, where the replacement cost $89 plus tax. The seller promptly reimbursed me after I provided them with the receipt.

A bonus surprise: while replacing the battery, the Apple technician accidentally damaged the screen and replaced it with a brand-new one at no additional cost. So, here‚Äôs a helpful tip‚Äîscreens are glued in with waterproof adhesive due to water resistance, which makes them tough to remove without heating. This makes battery replacements essential on any phone that‚Äôs 4+ years old, and you might save around $300 on a new screen if you go through Apple for repairs. Only Apple has the equipment to program replacement parts into the system, ensuring everything works seamlessly, as good as new.

Thanks to the seller for their prompt support and covering the replacement costs, making this purchase a worthwhile experience. Highly recommend!

Review: I didn‚Äôt expect a great quality phone that was pre owned. This phone came in with no dents scratches or any flaws. Battery is amazing! No problems. This is after already having the phone for a week.

Review: My son needed a new phone. I'm not the one to spend $1K or even $500 on a cell phone. I found this replacement and he is very pleased with it. He popped out his old SIM card and put it in the new phone, and it worked perfectly. Great price and fast shipping.
----------------------------------------
Review: the overall battery life is decreased slightly, however my phone does run great. was slight weary damage near the camera but other than that it looks great and clean. i highly recommend this if you dont wanna spend hundreds more dollars on a phone.

Review: When I received it -- straight from the package -- the volume down button was kinda janky. It works, but kind of sticks a little, and it doesn't *feel* like it works. It makes zero audible clicking noise - which I, personally, think the clicking noise is helpful because I can tell I've pressed the button - and I don't feel it click either. However everything else has been just fine. (It also would have been helpful if the box it shipped in was labelled "Unlocked", which was how I ordered it, and not "AT&T", which was how it was *actually* labelled. However I was able to figure that out.)

If thr volume key didn't have issues, I would give this product 5 out of 5.

Review: This product is an Apple iPhone 12 with 256 GB of storage, fully unlocked and tested to work seamlessly on both Verizon and T-Mobile/Metro networks. The phone boasts an improved camera system with AI-driven enhancements, capturing stunning 4K video. Compared to my previous iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 delivers noticeably sharper and superior video quality.

Although the phone arrived later than expected, I'm pleased with the purchase overall. This is the third phone I've bought through Amazon, and the first one that worked as expected. The first two were not authorized for service in the USA. Based on my experience, I recommend Amazon‚Äôs Renewed cell phone program for those looking to reduce waste by recycling and reusing electronics. However, the phone arrived with a few dents and messy adhesive, which took some effort to clean off using rubbing alcohol.

Shipping could have been faster, and I experienced a delay of about a week and a half before receiving the phone. I also wish Amazon would disclose the seller associated with your purchase before you buy, as some sellers provide better products than others. Fortunately, this particular seller did a great job renewing the phone.

The 256 GB of storage is a huge plus, leaving me with about 64 GB free after setup. It also came with a charger cable, but unfortunately, there was no official product manual, AirPods, or original box included.

If you don‚Äôt mind waiting and a bit of uncertainty, Amazon‚Äôs renewed phones tend to work out well thanks to their generous guarantee and return policy. It would be great, however, if refunds for defective purchases were processed more quickly. Lastly, Siri on this model feels different compared to my iPhone SE, likely because I don‚Äôt have the hardware needed to take full advantage of the new Apple Intelligence features on this device.

This product meets my expectations and hardware tests thus far. The battery life is good, and I was able to use it for about all day without needing to plug it in.
