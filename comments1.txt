Review: Mine came in flawless and the battery health is 100%. I have been buying phones through Amazon Renewed for the past 3 phones now and not one complaint. Much cheaper than buying a brand new one while still boasting almost the same condition. Highly recommend!
----------------------------------------
Review: I love this purchase the phone come with no scratches no crack. I was very easy to set up, no problems or any difficulties yall should give it a try
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone works as good as a new phone and in great condition. Arrived on time. It is not the color I ordered. Has a different kind of charger than my old phone but only came with the cord, not the wall plug.
----------------------------------------
Review: The cycle count is a bit higher than wanted and the maximum capacity is a bit low. I didn't expect a brand new phone but still was hoping for at least maximum capacity of 100%. Great color but a few searches and the battery does seem to die kind of faster than expected. For the price not too bad.
----------------------------------------
Review: PROS:
El movil funciona perfectamente y la bateria esta al 100% de su capacidad y con 0 ciclos de carga.
CONTRAS:
Tiene una pequeña rayada en la pantalla, que tal y como se indica es una posibilidad que asumes al comprar un telefono reacondicionado. Este estaba en estado "Excelente" asi que no deberia ser perceptible a 30cm. La verdad es que le he puesto un protector de pantalla y solo es perceptible si esta la pantalla en negro y te fijas, sino no se ve nada.
En la parte trasera tambien tiene una que parece mas sucio que rayado pero con una funda tampoco se nota tanto.
----------------------------------------
Review: Shipped VERY FAST. Needed for work ASAP. Near MINT condition and works perfectly and still well in warranty. What else could I ask for! Thank you :)

Review: 3.5 star out of 5

I have bought this iphone 15 256 gb renewed-excellent phone recently. I have been using it for 20 days now. One issue i’m having is battery usage. The battery drains pretty fast for an excellent condition phone. Im not a heavy user, as i used my phone for call, txt, online shopping, little bit social media and reading. If i start my day at 80% i need to charge it again around 11p to 1a of the next night. So im charging it everyday.
----------------------------------------
Review: The Phone did not come in the original box.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
Review: Received in nice packaging with a charging cable. Works perfectly.
----------------------------------------
Review: Llego rápido y con mucha seguridad para la entrega, lo único ea que debe ser detallado en la descripción que el teléfono funciona sólo con eSim ya que estoy fuera del país y no he podido activar la red móvil aún.
Por lo demás me gusto el servicio y la unidad comprada
----------------------------------------
Review: 100 percent battery and looks brand new

----------------------------------------
Review: Since I didn’t get the best refurbished one but its surpassed my expectations. I’d add a picture but I’m currently using the phone to type this review.
----------------------------------------
Review: If this phone is 'renewed' I would have no Idea what a new one would be like. super, super deal.

----------------------------------------
Review: fast delivery
----------------------------------------
Review: I never review however am highly impressed with this product. I recently broke my iPhone 15 and refused to buy the same phone for the same price at apple. After researching renewed options from different sites this option came up as the best priced for the best quality. I’ve bought renewed items before from others sellers / companies and have had issues, so I was a little nervous. When the phone arrived I was shocked at the quality. It looked brand new. No scratches or any issues at all. I will never buy a brand new phone again when I can buy it for half the price for the same quality. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE / PRODUCT
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought as a gift and the color is great
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered this phone back in April/may and I do not regret it one bit! It works great and the color is really pretty the camera quality is good too. The phone had no damages and everything is as it should be
----------------------------------------
Review: This company did a good job with taking care of this device i got a iphone 15 and it works perfectly. the packaging was not the greatest though there wasn’t enough bubble rap.
----------------------------------------
Review: Todo excelente lo unico malo es que por ignorancia no sabia que los iphone 15 no traian para meter SIM. Si vas a pedir uno para fuera de Usa primero ten seguro que te cumpañia acepta los eSIM
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered the wrong size but overall I love my iPhone 15!!!
----------------------------------------
Review: I love this phone, but there’s also some few things that I’ve noticed there were some scratches (hardly noticeable) and the charger that was given, didn’t come with the charging block, but I gave this 8 out of 10. I would recommend this to anybody.
----------------------------------------
Review: This IPhone 15 came earlier than I expected and it made me feel better because my iPhone 8 was getting slow. I am really satisfied with this phone and for the price you can’t beat a nice hand me down phone without any scratches. Thank you for the amazing deal on a good phone, I chose this phone for the camera and it is worth it. Now I can take some good pictures of all sorts of things!
----------------------------------------
Review: My phone was delivered and it worked well enough but it was delivered with scratches on the screen. When I brought it to the attention of the seller. I was told I would receive a $30 . The money was never sent to my account. Disappointed.
----------------------------------------
Review: Upgraded from my iPhone 11 that was suffering due to poor battery health after many years of use. Was nervous about buying a refurbished iPhone but thought that Amazon is a trusted shopping center that I might give it a try to buy the new iPhone 15 for a discount through this seller. This iPhone 15 is a great upgrade. I watched a few videos online to make sure this phone was authentic and from my observation it is just like new. The phone came with 100% battery health and only 12 cycles on it. Battery works really well. Has a 5G connection and setting up the phone with my cell carrier Verizon was a breeze with e-sim feature. The phone came with a charger as well. The camera takes really great quality photos as well (Picture of the pink rose is the iPhone 15’s camera quality). You should expect to find all iPhone 15 features on this phone, including the Dynamic Island, if you so choose to purchase this refurbished model. The only fault on this phone is that it heats up every time I’m on a video call. However, through research it seems this problem might be the same with all iPhone 15 models through Apple. After my experience shopping for this new phone I would consider buying a refurbished device in the future with Amazon again as well. Such a great deal for a new phone.
----------------------------------------
Review: 10/10 brand new 100% battery life with not a single scratch

----------------------------------------
Review: Excellent battery life. Almost brand new. I will buy from this seller again.
----------------------------------------
Review: It was time for me to upgrade my old iPhone 7 since it was not updating to the latest iOS. I researched and decided I got the best bang for my buck if I went for the iPhone 15 rather than the iPhone 13. The quality of the unlocked refurbished phone is outstanding. It's just like new except for the packaging. I especially appreciate the much longer battery life as my previous phone I had to recharge constantly during the day. On this one the battery lasts all day. I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera often but it seems there are a few nice options on there. The extra black space at the top of the phone shows any extra application you may be using in tandem with what's on the face of the phone. This is really handy, for example, if you're using the Google navigation and go away from that to check your messages.
----------------------------------------
Review: For those who are scared of buying from this user this product is really good I’m only 16 and it is amazing hasn’t cause my problems comes with a charger but no block .Mine looks brand new not a single scratch or crack
----------------------------------------

Review: got it pretty quick , no scratches and works great
----------------------------------------
Review: Screen shows some pink lines in the sunlight but seems to work fine
----------------------------------------
Review: My hesitation to buy this IPhone from Amazon’s renewed program was unwarranted. The phone arrived in excellent condition. The battery charged to 100%, showed 6 cycles and there were no bumps, bruises or knots that indicated hard use or wear and tear—just a barely noticeable nick on the screen. . Transferring data from my 11Pro to the 15 was fast and easy. The only challenge I experienced was installing the ESim card and my carrier helped with that. So far, I haven’t experienced problems with the applications I use most often. My tablet and watch connected easily and I have twice the capacity of my old phone. After reading about the renew program, I felt much safer than going through other Marketplaces where there is no guarantee for the product you purchase.Winning!
----------------------------------------
Review: Couldn’t get it to transfer everything over
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered this phone because it was cheaper than a renewed one on the Apple site. I did watch a lot of videos about fake iPhone 15. And this one passed all the tests. I was happy to see that the battery is 100% capacity. And it only had eight cycles when I got it. There was a tiny bit of scratching on the screen, but with the screen protector I put on I can’t even tell. I think I will keep getting Amazon renewed phones from now on. My last phone was an iPhone RX so this is a huge upgrade.
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought this iPhone 15 for my son. He’s in college. He’s no longer complaining. His previous phone was a 13 mini. The phone was in excellent condition and had him put on an otter box case before it left the house. I got his 13 mini now. Cleaned the ports, replaced screen and got a new battery. The15 is better for him and he likes it very much.
----------------------------------------
Review: Not so superb but decent product quality
----------------------------------------
Review: Came perfect, in a week, battery percentage was at max, which made me surprise, would totally recommend🙏
----------------------------------------
Review: The iPhone was shipped fast, came in charged and ready to go. iPhone was as stated, unlocked and I was able to connect it to my service in minutes. Overall experience, Very Good.
----------------------------------------
Review: Si bien es un producto renovado el producto tiene fallas en la pantalla
----------------------------------------
Review: Bought a new phone from my carrier for $830 when the same phone was on here in practically the same condition for almost $200 less! Returned the other one and kept this one and it was the easiest $200 I’ve saved. At first I wasn’t sure about ordering a phone online but seller and Amazon were quick to ease any worries and offered returns easily.
----------------------------------------
Review: I had only 3 cycles on this phone, and battery health was at 100%, it was also in perfect condition appearance wise.
----------------------------------------
Review: Wonderful so far
----------------------------------------
Review: I was a bit hesitant due to the latest reviews but it works really well. I bought a renewed iPhone 15 128gb. Came exactly on time and been using it for 2 weeks. Great seller.
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone is like new…no signs of use. The only thing is it is not blue like in the pictures…looks white.
----------------------------------------
Review: I recently purchased an iPhone and couldn't be happier with my decision! The price was incredibly affordable, and the quality of the product is top-notch. It works perfectly and looks brand new. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal on a high-quality phone!
----------------------------------------
Review: it was good nothing wrong with it
----------------------------------------
Review: Upon receiving my product, it came with two small scratches on the screen. It Doesn't look like its impeding anything, so i would say this was a score. It came in fast, and overall, its cheaper than buying new. I would purchase this way again.
----------------------------------------
Review: Very happy with my refurbished iPhone 15. Have been using it for several weeks and it has not given me any problems.
----------------------------------------
Review: New phone, 100% battery health, no signs of use on the exterior
----------------------------------------
Review: I just bought the iPhone 15 with 256Gb memory for $710. The battery had 2 cycles on it. Manufactured in Dec 2023. First used May 2024. Easy set-up with eSIM (just to type in the IMEI) and super simple transfer of data from my trusted, but aging iPhone 7+. The phone had no scratches - condition as new (excellent). What is not to like 😂 Happy to spend $200 less 😊
----------------------------------------
Review: Phone came really fast. I bought the phone on July 20th, phone was expected to arrive by Wednesday but instead came by today which is Monday. Phone is in excellent condition and everything works perfectly. It doesn’t come with the original box or charger however a charger is provided which charges really fast! I would definitely buy again! Also comes with no scratches whatsoever!
----------------------------------------
Review: El teléfono es exactamente lo descrito, adquirí la versión en estado excelente y nada que decir, el estado del teléfono se veía inmaculado, estado de la batería al 100% con 19 ciclos de uso, talvez no como salido se fabrica pero prácticamente nuevo.

Todas las funciones intactas, número de serie revisado en la página de Apple en el cual pude verificar la originalidad del teléfono (nada de bootlegs o copias chinas).

Únicamente a tomar en cuenta que debido a que es un dispositivo proveniente de USA opera con eSIM, por si planean comprar desde fuera del territorio o enviárselo a un familiar para cerciorarse de poder realizar este cambio si usan SIM físico.
----------------------------------------
Review: love! had a 13 pro before so i lost a few features since this one isn’t a pro but other then that the battery health was at 100%, and a few very small scratches on screen but you can’t see them at all with a screen protector on it. so far no issues
----------------------------------------
Review: The phone doesn’t seem to always respond that well and seems prone to third-party influences or viruses or however, you put the word. I don’t know if it’s because of where the product came from or what, however, overall I’m able to utilize the phone as normal. However, being a return user to Apple products I would have just stuck with either a Google phone or some other android based platform phone
----------------------------------------
Review: Excellent condition, like new in appearance. No scratches, 100% battery capacity
----------------------------------------
Review: This is a very good product to invest in, i got mine with only one charge cycle. i’m very happy with my purchase i definitely will order from this store again!
----------------------------------------
Review: The exterior condition of the phone is perfect. Just like brand new so it lived up to the excellent condition rating. The battery health was 100% with 191 cycles when received. Couldn’t ask for a better used phone 👍
----------------------------------------
Review: My renewed iphone came with very minimal defects (1 or 2 small one on the sides). Almost to small to notice. The screen was protected by a protector and also a sleeve on top of a plastic bag. The box it came in was secure on all sides and the phone was placed in a plastic holder. Ive used the phone for almost 2 days and have 0 issues or concerns. The phone only took 3 days to ship!
----------------------------------------
Review: arrived in perfect condition with 100% battery capacity. no scratches or dents. 10/10
----------------------------------------
Review: The seller I used was WeDeliverWireless. The phone I received has zero scratches or any other blemishes, basically like it looks brand new. The only thing I noticed is that the charger hole seemed a little dirty/stained but honestly not that much at all. (See picture, you can see the white part is a little dirty?) The phone came bubble-wrapped nicely with a charger. I checked the day after activating it, and it says there were 51 charge cycles and the battery health is 100% (may have been 50 before I used it). Amazing and I can’t wait to use it!
----------------------------------------
Review: This phone is unlocked as advertised and works in every way an iPhone 15 should (great signal strength, high quality cameras and sound, long battery life, etc). The only negative thing I have noticed is that occasionally the app I am on will crash.
----------------------------------------
Review: 1 cycle ande 100% battery
----------------------------------------
Review: I m very impressed my iPhone 14 . I ordered as an acceptable condition and price was very low. I was worried about phone but soon as I received phone was excellent condition with very minor scratches on the side and no issues, working perfectly like new. I m strongly recommended. Thank you.5 star rating
----------------------------------------
Review: First I ran over, then buried, my old iPhone 13 with my backhoe tractor while removing a stump about 5 feet deep. My wife had to call my old phone and make it ring until I could unbury it and find it. When I did, it was basically shattered with the front and back glass shattered. TO repair it (replace the glass by ubreakifix or iPhone doctors, it was going to cost me about $600. So, I took a chance and decided to buy this online through amazon. IT IS PEFECT! No defects, no issues, no problems and I have had it for about 3 months now. Easy transfer from my old phone to this, everything sinked up, easy peasy! If you're looking for a phone, for half the price, this is it!
----------------------------------------
Review: I have had this iPhone for 38 days.
It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.

This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .

The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.
It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.
On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!
I absolutely loved the phone!
I never had a single problem with it.
Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.

I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.

It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.
It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be "worn" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.

Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.
I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.
I can live with that.

Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.
So this phone is dying quickly.

After being fully charged it dies within hours.
I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.
I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.
I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.

I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.
I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.
Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.

On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.

As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.
I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.
This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.
They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.

I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.

Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.

The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?
Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?
That is extremely hard to do financially!
I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!

Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.
I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.
I am also having several medical issues.
Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.
I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.

I just don't know what to do.
----------------------------------------
Review: Good condition! Screen was good no cracks or scratches! Everything about this phone is good . No issues on any part .
----------------------------------------
Review: Came with minor scratches on the camera but other than that the exterior was flawless. The phone works great and came with 95% battery health. Would definitely recommend.
----------------------------------------
Review: I ordered the blue iPhone 14. It came in the mail less than four days after ordering it was packaged well it was a good phone. There was no outer damage. I was able to connect it to my service so I would say absolutely if you’re looking for a good iPhone this is the way to go.
----------------------------------------
Review: The seller is great, we had to send back the first phone because we thought it was defective, it turned out that there is a significant conflict with the portability of the old phone information and 18.0.1 upgrade. When we cut on the phone we set it up to transfer the old phone material first, then it wanted to upgrade the software prior to the transfer. The upgrade spooled around for 18 hrs, then the portability function (over WiFi and Cloud) simply would not work. AT&T couldnt figure it out....we sent the phone back thinking it was defective (turns out it was fine), got a new phone same model, etc.
New phone had the same issues, and I was thinking at this point it cannot be coincidence so it must me a software conflict. And....it was. After MUCH tinkering with it here is the workaround for those of you who are in the same situation (as an aside, we were upgrading my wife's ancient XE to a 14 but I think this happens with a lot of phones no matter the model)
1. Cut on the new phone
2. Opt to NOT set up the new phone with the old phone (ie, do NOT transfer the old phone data yet).
3. Go to settings, opt to update the software to 18.0.1
4. After this, ERASE the phone. It will keep 18.0.1 on there, it will remove any impediments to port over the information.
5. KEEP the e-sim information on there(it gives you that option when you erase, it is ok not to do it but you will have to put it back on so just keep it on).
6. Boot the phone back up
7. OPT to set it up with the old phone (likely the older phone will prompt you for this first).
8. You can set it up over Wifi or Cloud, make sure you have backed up the old phone on the cloud just before set up if you opt for that.
9. There is an option to use direct cabling to transfer, but it is a pain because Apple insists on using the proprietary cabling they have, so it means you have to first port everything onto a laptop then transfer it. Safer but not any quicker. I would not do that unless you have cloud issues and/or bad WiFi.

Phone has worked great since we did the workaround, and I want to compliment the seller as they were quick to send a replacement phone to us and very communicative on the issues. I hope the workaround here helps others, it was utterly baffling to us. Apple needs to get it together on the portability issues since they just released the new model and apparently this is an issue with a number of older to newer transfers, very disappointing for them to not catch this.
----------------------------------------
Review: No signs of wear and tear, 100% battery health, looks like new, the speakers sound awesome, the screen seems genuine as far as I can tell and there are no error messages about non original parts, everything functions as expected and it’s a great value! 10/10 recommend!
----------------------------------------
Review: I like it overall. The screen isn’t cracked the camera is good but there’s a few scratches around the phone not the back of it. The sound is good but the battery life is 87% and I bought excellent condition
----------------------------------------
Review: This phone was listed as EXCELLENT condition and it was! My only complaint is that the battery life is not as good as I had hoped. Risky packaging for shipping.
----------------------------------------
